## Requirements

Ax requires Python 3.10 or newer. A full list of Ax's direct dependencies can be
found in [setup.py](https://github.com/facebook/Ax/blob/main/setup.py).

## Installing Ax (stable)

We recommend installing Ax via pip, even if using Conda environment:

```shell
pip install ax-platform
```

Installation will use Python wheels from PyPI, available for
[OSX, Linux, and Windows](https://pypi.org/project/ax-platform/#files).

_Note_: Make sure the `pip` being used to install `ax-platform` is actually the
one from the newly created Conda environment. If you're using a Unix-based OS,
you can use `which pip` to check.

### Installing with Extras

Ax can be installed with additional dependencies, which are not included in the
default installation. For example, in order to use Ax within a Jupyter notebook,
install Ax with the `notebook` extra:

```shell
pip install "ax-platform[notebook]"
```

Extras for running Ax's tutorial's locally (`tutorials`) and for installing all
dependencies necessary for developing Ax (`dev`) are also available.

## Install Ax from source

You can install the latest (bleeding edge) version from GitHub using `pip`.

The bleeding edge for Ax depends on bleeding edge versions of BoTorch and
GPyTorch. We therefore recommend installing those from Github, as well as
setting the following environment variables to allow the Ax to use the latest
version of both BoTorch and GPyTorch.

```shell
export ALLOW_LATEST_GPYTORCH_LINOP=true
export ALLOW_BOTORCH_LATEST=true

pip install git+https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch.git
pip install git+https://github.com/pytorch/botorch.git

pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebook/Ax.git#egg=ax-platform'
```
