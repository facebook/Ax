## Requirements

Ax requires Python 3.10 or newer.
A full list of Ax's direct dependencies can be found in [setup.py](https://github.com/facebook/Ax/blob/main/setup.py).

## Installing Ax (stable)
We recommend installing Ax via pip, even if using Conda environment:

```shell
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch  # OSX only (details below)
pip install ax-platform
```

Installation will use Python wheels from PyPI, available for [OSX, Linux, and Windows](https://pypi.org/project/ax-platform/#files).

_Note_: Make sure the `pip` being used to install `ax-platform` is actually the one from the newly created Conda environment.
If you're using a Unix-based OS, you can use `which pip` to check.

_Recommendation for MacOS users_: PyTorch is a required dependency of BoTorch, and can be automatically installed via pip.
However, **we recommend you [install PyTorch manually](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#anaconda-1) before installing Ax, using the Anaconda package manager**.
Installing from Anaconda will link against MKL (a library that optimizes mathematical computation for Intel processors).
This will result in up to an order-of-magnitude speed-up for Bayesian optimization, whereas installing PyTorch from pip does not link against MKL.

If you need CUDA on MacOS, you will need to build PyTorch from source. Please consult the PyTorch installation instructions above.

### Installing with Extras
Ax can be installed with additional dependencies, which are not included in the default installation.
For example, in order to use Ax within a Jupyter notebook, install Ax with the `notebook` extra:

```shell
pip install ax-platform[notebook]
```

Extras for using Ax with MySQL storage (`mysql`), for running Ax's tutorial's locally (`tutorials`), and for installing all dependencies necessary for developing Ax (`dev`) are also available.

## Install Ax from source

You can install the latest (bleeding edge) version from GitHub:

```shell
pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebook/Ax.git#egg=ax-platform'
```

See also the recommendation for installing PyTorch for MacOS users above.

The bleeding edge for Ax depends on bleeding edge versions of BoTorch and GPyTorch.
We therefore recommend installing those from Git as well:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch.git
pip install git+https://github.com/pytorch/botorch.git
```
