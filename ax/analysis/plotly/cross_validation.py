    """
    Plotly Scatter plot for cross validation for model predictions using the current
    model on the GenerationStrategy. This plot is useful for understanding how well
    the model is able to predict out-of-sample which in turn is indicative of its
    ability to suggest valuable candidates.

    Splits the model's training data into train/test folds and makes
    out-of-sample predictions on the test folds.

    A well fit model will have points clustered around the y=x line, and a model with
    poor fit may have points in a horizontal band in the center of the plot
    indicating a tendency to predict the observed mean of the specificed metric for
    all arms.

    The DataFrame computed will contain one row per arm and the following columns:
        - arm_name: The name of the arm
        - observed: The observed mean of the metric specified
        - observed_sem: The SEM of the observed mean of the metric specified
        - predicted: The predicted mean of the metric specified
        - predicted_sem: The SEM of the predicted mean of the metric specified

            metric_name: The name of the metric to plot. If not specified the objective
                will be used. Note that the metric cannot be inferred for
                multi-objective or scalarized-objective experiments.
            folds: Number of subsamples to partition observations into. Use -1 for
                leave-one-out cross validation.
            untransform: Whether to untransform the model predictions before cross
                validating. Models are trained on transformed data, and candidate
                generation is performed in the transformed space. Computing the model
                quality metric based on the cross-validation results in the
                untransformed space may not be representative of the model that
                is actually used for candidate generation in case of non-invertible
                transforms, e.g., Winsorize or LogY. While the model in the
                transformed space may not be representative of the original data in
                regions where outliers have been removed, we have found it to better
                reflect the how good the model used for candidate generation actually
                is.
            trial_index: Optional trial index that the model from generation_strategy
                was used to generate.  We should therefore only have observations from
                trials prior to this trial index in our plot.  If this is not True, we
                should error out.
