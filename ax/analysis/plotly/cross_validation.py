    Plotly Scatter plot for cross validation for model predictions using the current
    model on the GenerationStrategy. This plot is useful for understanding how well
    the model is able to predict out-of-sample which in turn is indicative of its
    ability to suggest valuable candidates.

    Splits the model's training data into train/test folds and makes
    out-of-sample predictions on the test folds.

    A well fit model will have points clustered around the y=x line, and a model with
    poor fit may have points in a horizontal band in the center of the plot
    indicating a tendency to predict the observed mean of the specificed metric for
    all arms.

    The DataFrame computed will contain one row per arm and the following columns:
        - arm_name: The name of the arm
        - observed: The observed mean of the metric specified
        - observed_sem: The SEM of the observed mean of the metric specified
