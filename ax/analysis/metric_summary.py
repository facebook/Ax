    Creates a dataframe with information about each metric in the

        - Name: the name of the metric.
        - Type: the metric subclass (e.g., Metric, BraninMetric).
        - Goal: the goal for this for this metric, based on the optimization
            config (minimize, maximize, constraint or track).
        - Bound: the bound of this metric (e.g., "<=10.0") if it is being used
            as part of an ObjectiveThreshold or OutcomeConstraint.
        - Lower is Better: whether the user prefers this metric to be lower,
            if provided.
