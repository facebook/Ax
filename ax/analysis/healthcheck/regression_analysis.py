class RegressionAnalysis(HealthcheckAnalysis):
    r"""
    Analysis for detecting the regressing arm, metric pairs across all trials with data.
    For each metric, the regressions are defined as the arms that have a probability of
    regression above the threshold. The regression probabilities are calculated as
    posterior probabilities of the metric being above or below zero (depending if the
    metric is improving in the negative or positive direction), where the
    posteriors are with respect to the EBAshr
    (empirical Bayes Adaptive Shrinkage Model).
