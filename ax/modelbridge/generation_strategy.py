    """One step in the generation strategy, corresponds to a single model.
    Describes the model, how many trials will be generated with this model, what
    minimum number of observations is required to proceed to the next model, etc.

    NOTE: Model can be specified either from the model registry
    (`ax.modelbridge.registry.Models` or using a callable model constructor. Only
    models from the registry can be saved, and thus optimization can only be
    resumed if interrupted when using models from the registry.

    Args:
        model: A member of `Models` enum or a callable returning an instance of
            `ModelBridge` with an instantiated underlying `Model`. Refer to
            `ax/modelbridge/factory.py` for examples of such callables.
        num_trials: How many trials to generate with the model from this step.
            If set to -1, trials will continue to be generated from this model
            as long as `generation_strategy.gen` is called (available only for
            the last of the generation steps).
        min_trials_observed: How many trials must be completed before the
            generation strategy can proceed to the next step. Defaults to 0.
            If `num_trials` of a given step have been generated but `min_trials_
            observed` have not been completed, a call to `generation_strategy.gen`
            will fail with a `DataRequiredError`.
        max_parallelism: How many trials generated in the course of this step are
            allowed to be run (i.e. have `trial.status` of `RUNNING`) simultaneously.
            If `max_parallelism` trials from this step are already running, a call
            to `generation_strategy.gen` will fail with a `MaxParallelismReached
            Exception`, indicating that more trials need to be completed before
            generating and running next trials.
        use_update: Whether to use `model_bridge.update` instead or reinstantiating
            model + bridge on every call to `gen` within a single generation step.
            NOTE: use of `update` on stateful models that do not implement `_get_state`
            may result in inability to correctly resume a generation strategy from
            a serialized state.
        enforce_num_trials: Whether to enforce that only `num_trials` are generated
            from the given step. If False and `num_trials` have been generated, but
            `min_trials_observed` have not been completed, `generation_strategy.gen`
            will continue generating trials from the current step, exceeding `num_
            trials` for it. Allows to avoid `DataRequiredError`, but delays
            proceeding to next generation step.
        model_kwargs: Dictionary of kwargs to pass into the model constructor on
            instantiation. E.g. if `model` is `Models.SOBOL`, kwargs will be applied
            as `Models.SOBOL(**model_kwargs)`; if `model` is `get_sobol`, `get_sobol(
            **model_kwargs)`. NOTE: if generation strategy is interrupted and
            resumed from a stored snapshot and its last used model has state saved on
            its generator runs, `model_kwargs` is updated with the state dict of the
            model, retrieved from the last generator run of this generation strategy.
        model_gen_kwargs: Each call to `generation_strategy.gen` performs a call to the
            step's model's `gen` under the hood; `model_gen_kwargs` will be passed to
            the model's `gen` like so: `model.gen(**model_gen_kwargs)`.
        index: Index of this generation step, for use internally in `Generation
            Strategy`. Do not assign as it will be reassigned when instantiating
            `GenerationStrategy` with a list of its steps.
        should_deduplicate: Whether to deduplicate the parameters of proposed arms
            against those of previous arms via rejection sampling. If this is True,
            the generation strategy will discard generator runs produced from the
            generation step that has `should_deduplicate=True` if they contain arms
            already present on the experiment and replace them with new generator runs.
            If no generator run with entirely unique arms could be produced in 5
            attempts, a `GenerationStrategyCompleted` error will be raised, as we
            assume that the optimization converged when the model can no longer suggest
            unique arms.
