        While most models in Ax aren't stateful, some models, like `SobolGenerator`,
        are. For Sobol, the value of the `init_position` changes throughout the
        generation process as more arms are generated, and restoring the Sobol
        generator with all the same settings as it was initialized with, will not
        result in the same model, because the `init_position` setting changed
        throughout optimization. Stateful settings like that are returned from
        this method, so that a model can be reinstantiated and 'pick up where it
        left off' –– more arms can be generated as if the model just continued
        generation and was never interrupted and serialized.
