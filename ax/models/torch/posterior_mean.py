    Note: If no OutcomeConstraints given, return an analytic acquisition
    function. This requires {optimizer_kwargs: {joint_optimization: True}} or an
    optimizer that does not assume pending point support.

    Args:
        objective_weights: The objective is to maximize a weighted sum of
            the columns of f(x). These are the weights.
        outcome_constraints: A tuple of (A, b). For k outcome constraints
            and m outputs at f(x), A is (k x m) and b is (k x 1) such that
            A f(x) <= b. (Not used by single task models)
        X_observed: A tensor containing points observed for all objective
            outcomes and outcomes that appear in the outcome constraints (if
            there are any).
        X_pending: A tensor containing points whose evaluation is pending (i.e.
            that have been submitted for evaluation) present for all objective
            outcomes and outcomes that appear in the outcome constraints (if
            there are any).

    Returns:
        PosteriorMean: The instantiated acquisition function.
