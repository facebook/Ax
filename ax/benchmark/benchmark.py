"""
Module for benchmarking Ax algorithms.

Key terms used:

* Trial –– usual Ax `Trial` or `BatchTral`, one execution of a given arm or
  group of arms.
* Replication –– one run of an optimization loop; 1 method + problem combination.
* Test –– multiple replications, ran for statistical significance.
* Full run –– multiple tests: run all methods with all problems.
* Method –– (one of) the algorithm(s) being benchmarked.
* Problem –– a synthetic function, a surrogate surface, or an ML model, on which
  to assess the performance of algorithms.

    scipy.optimize.minimize. This function will return a callable evaluation
    function that takes in an array of parameter values and returns a float
    objective value. The evaluation function should always be minimized: if the
    benchmark problem is a maximization problem, then the value returned by
    the evaluation function will be negated so it can be used directly by
    methods that minimize. This callable can be given to an external
    minimization function, and Ax will track all of the calls made to it and
    the arms that were evaluated.

    This will also return an Experiment object that will track the arms
    evaluated by the external method in the same way as done for Ax
    internal benchmarks. This function should thus be used for each benchmark
    replication.

    Args:
        problem: The Ax benchmark problem to be used to construct the
            evalutaion function.
        num_trials: The maximum number of trials for a benchmark run.
        method_name: Name of the method being tested.
        replication_index: Replicate number, if multiple replicates are being
            run.
