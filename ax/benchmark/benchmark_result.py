@dataclass(eq=False)
class BenchmarkResult(Base):
    """The result of a single optimization loop from one
    (BenchmarkProblem, BenchmarkMethod) pair.

    Args:
        name: Name of the benchmark. Should make it possible to determine the
            problem and the method.
        seed: Seed used for determinism.
        oracle_trace: For single-objective problems, element i of the
            optimization trace is the best oracle value of the arms evaluated
            after the first i trials.  For multi-objective problems, element i
            of the optimization trace is the hypervolume of the oracle values of
            the arms in the first i trials (which may be ``BatchTrial``s).
            Oracle values are typically ground-truth (rather than noisy) and
            evaluated at the target task and fidelity.
        inference_trace: Inference trace comes from choosing a "best" point
            based only on data that would be observable in realistic settings
            and then evaluating the oracle value of that point. For
            multi-objective problems, we find a Pareto set and evaluate its
            hypervolume.

            There are several ways of specifying the "best" point: One could
            pick the point with the best observed value, or the point with the
            best model prediction, and could consider the whole search space,
            the set of trials completed so far, etc. How the inference trace is
            computed is specified by a best-point selector, which is an
            attribute of the `BenchmarkMethod`.

            Note: This is not "inference regret", which is a lower-is-better value
            that is relative to the best possible value. The inference value
            trace is higher-is-better if the problem is a maximization problem
            or if the problem is multi-objective (in which case hypervolume is
            used). Hence, it is signed the same as ``oracle_trace`` and
            ``optimization_trace``. ``score_trace`` is higher-is-better and
            relative to the optimum.
        optimization_trace: Either the ``oracle_trace`` or the
            ``inference_trace``, depending on whether the ``BenchmarkProblem``
            specifies ``report_inference_value``. Having ``optimization_trace``
            specified separately is useful when we need just one value to
            evaluate how well the benchmark went.
        score_trace: The scores associated with the problem, typically either
            the optimization_trace or inference_value_trace normalized to a
            0-100 scale for comparability between problems.
        fit_time: Total time spent fitting models.
        gen_time: Total time spent generating candidates.
        experiment: If not ``None``, the Ax experiment associated with the
            optimization that generated this data. Either ``experiment`` or
            ``experiment_storage_id`` must be provided.
        experiment_storage_id: Pointer to location where experiment data can be read.
