    """Estimation method for Positive-part James-Stein estimator.

    This method takes a vector of K means (`y_i`) and standard errors
    (`sigma_i`) and calculates the positive-part James Stein estimator.

    Resulting estimates are the shrunk means and standard errors. The positive
    part James-Stein estimator shrinks each constituent average to the grand
    average:

        y_i - phi_i * y_i + phi_i * ybar

    The variable phi_i determines the amount of shrinkage. For `phi_i = 1`,
    `mu_hat` is equal to `ybar` (the mean of all `y_i`), while for `phi_i = 0`,
    `mu_hat` is equal to `y_i`. It can be shown that restricting `phi_i <= 1`
    dominates the unrestricted estimator, so this method restricts `phi_i` in
    this manner. The amount of shrinkage, `phi_i`, is determined by:

        (K - 3) * sigma2_i / s2

    That is, less shrinkage is applied when individual means are estimated with
    greater precision, and more shrinkage is applied when individual means are
    very tightly clustered together. We also restrict `phi_i` to never be larger
    than 1.

    The variance of the mean estimator is:

        (1 - phi_i) * sigma2_i
        + phi * sigma2_i / K
        + 2 * phi_i ** 2 * (y_i - ybar)^2 / (K - 3)

    The first term is the variance component from `y_i`, the second term is the
    contribution from the mean of all `y_i`, and the third term is the
    contribution from the uncertainty in the sum of squared deviations of `y_i`
    from the mean of all `y_i`.

    """Ratio estimator based on the delta method.

    This uses the delta method (i.e. a Taylor series approximation) to estimate
    the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the ratio
    between test and control -- that is, the sampling distribution of an
    estimator of the true population value under the assumption that the means
    in test and control have a known covariance:

        (mu_t / mu_c) - 1.

    Under a second-order Taylor expansion, the sampling distribution of the
    relative change in empirical means, which is `m_t / m_c - 1`, is
    approximately normally distributed with mean

        [(mu_t - mu_c) / mu_c] - [(sigma_c)^2 * mu_t] / (mu_c)^3

    and variance

        (sigma_t / mu_c)^2
        - 2 * mu_t _ sigma_tc / mu_c^3
        + [(sigma_c * mu_t)^2 / (mu_c)^4]

    as the higher terms are assumed to be close to zero in the full Taylor
    series. To estimate these parameters, we plug in the empirical means and
    standard errors. This gives us the estimators:

        [(m_t - m_c) / m_c] - [(s_c)^2 * m_t] / (m_c)^3

    and

        (s_t / m_c)^2 - 2 * m_t * s_tc / m_c^3 + [(s_c * m_t)^2 / (m_c)^4]

    Note that the delta method does NOT take as input the empirical standard
    deviation of a metric, but rather the standard error of the mean of that
    metric -- that is, the standard deviation of the metric after division by
    the square root of the total number of observations.
