        """Construct a PercentileEarlyStoppingStrategy instance.

        Args:
            metric_names: A (length-one) list of name of the metric to observe. If
                None will default to the objective metric on the Experiment's
                OptimizationConfig.
            seconds_between_polls: How often to poll the early stopping metric to
                evaluate whether or not the trial should be early stopped.
            percentile_threshold: Falling below this threshold compared to other trials
                at the same step will stop the run. Must be between 0.0 and 100.0.
                e.g. if percentile_threshold=25.0, the bottom 25% of trials are stopped.
                Note that "bottom" here is determined based on performance, not
                absolute values; if `minimize` is False, then "bottom" actually refers
                to the top trials in terms of metric value.
            min_progression: Only stop trials if the latest progression value
                (e.g. timestamp, epochs, training data used) is greater than this
                threshold. Prevents stopping prematurely before enough data is gathered
                to make a decision.
            max_progression: Do not stop trials that have passed `max_progression`.
                Useful if we prefer finishing a trial that are already near completion.
            min_curves: Trials will not be stopped until a number of trials
                `min_curves` have completed with curve data attached. That is, if
                `min_curves` trials are completed but their curve data was not
                successfully retrieved, further trials may not be early-stopped.
            trial_indices_to_ignore: Trial indices that should not be early stopped.
            true_objective_metric_name: The actual objective to be optimized; used in
                situations where early stopping uses a proxy objective (such as training
                loss instead of eval loss) for stopping decisions.
            normalize_progressions: Normalizes the progression column of the MapData df
                by dividing by the max. If the values were originally in [0, `prog_max`]
                (as we would expect), the transformed values will be in [0, 1]. Useful
                for inferring the max progression and allows `min_progression` to be
                specified in the transformed space. IMPORTANT: Typically, `min_curves`
                should be > 0 to ensure that at least one trial has completed and that
                we have a reliable approximation for `prog_max`.
