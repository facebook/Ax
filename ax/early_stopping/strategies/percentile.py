        Args:
            metric_names: A (length-one) list of name of the metric to observe. If
                None will default to the objective metric on the Experiment's
                OptimizationConfig.
            seconds_between_polls: How often to poll the early stopping metric to
                evaluate whether or not the trial should be early stopped.
            true_objective_metric_name: The actual objective to be optimized; used in
                situations where early stopping uses a proxy objective (such as training
                loss instead of eval loss) for stopping decisions.
            percentile_threshold: Falling below this threshold compared to other trials
                at the same step will stop the run. Must be between 0.0 and 100.0.
                e.g. if percentile_threshold=25.0, the bottom 25% of trials are stopped.
                Note that "bottom" here is determined based on performance, not
                absolute values; if `minimize` is False, then "bottom" actually refers
                to the top trials in terms of metric value.
            min_progression: Only stop trials if the latest progression value
                (e.g. timestamp, epochs, training data used) is greater than this
                threshold. Prevents stopping prematurely before enough data is gathered
                to make a decision. The default value (10) is reasonable when we want
                early stopping to start after 10 epochs.
            min_curves: There must be `min_curves` number of completed trials and
                `min_curves` number of trials with curve data to make a stopping
                decision (i.e., even if there are enough completed trials but not all
                of them are correctly returning data, then do not apply early stopping).
