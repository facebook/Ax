    """Helper function to align partial results with heterogeneous index

    Args:
        df: The DataFrame containing the raw data (in long format).
        progr_key: The key of the column indexing progression (such as
            the number of training examples, timestamps, etc.).
        metrics: The names of the metrics to consider.
        interpolation: The interpolation method used to fill missing values
            (if applicable). See `pandas.DataFrame.interpolate` for
            available options. Limit area is `inside`.
        forward_fill: If True, performs a forward fill after interpolation.
            This is useful for scalarizing learning curves when some data
            is missing. For instance, suppose we obtain a curve for task_1
            for progression in [a, b] and task_2 for progression in [c, d]
            where b < c. Performing the forward fill on task_1 is a possible
            solution.

    Returns:
        A two-tuple containing a dict mapping the provided metric names to the
        index-normalized and interpolated mean (sem).
