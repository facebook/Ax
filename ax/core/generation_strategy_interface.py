                a new generator run in the course of ``gen``, and to which that
                generator run will be added as trial(s). Information stored on the
                experiment (e.g., trial statuses) is used to determine which model
                will be used to produce the generator run returned from this method.
            data: Optional data to be passed to the underlying model's ``gen``, which
                is called within this method and actually produces the resulting
                generator run. By default, data is all data on the ``experiment``.
            n: Integer representing how many trials should be in the generator run
                produced by this method. NOTE: Some underlying models may ignore
                the ``n`` and produce a model-determined number of arms. In that

                observations for that metric, used by some models to avoid
                resuggesting points that are currently being evaluated.

            A list of lists of ``GeneratorRun``-s. Each outer list item represents
            a ``(Batch)Trial`` being suggested, with a list of ``GeneratorRun``-s for
