        ensembling, or using multiple models per trial, getting multiple
        GeneratorRuns per trial.

        Args:
            experiment: Experiment, for which the generation strategy is producing
                a new generator run in the course of `gen`, and to which that
                generator run will be added as trial(s). Information stored on the
                experiment (e.g., trial statuses) is used to determine which model
                will be used to produce the generator run returned from this method.
            data: Optional data to be passed to the underlying model's `gen`, which
                is called within this method and actually produces the resulting
                generator run. By default, data is all data on the `experiment`.
            n: Integer representing how many trials should be in the generator run
                produced by this method. NOTE: Some underlying models may ignore
                the ``n`` and produce a model-determined number of arms. In that
                case this method will also output a generator run with number of
                arms that can differ from ``n``.
            pending_observations: A map from metric name to pending
                observations for that metric, used by some models to avoid
                resuggesting points that are currently being evaluated.
            extra_gen_metadata: A dictionary containing any additional metadata
                to be attached to created GeneratorRuns.

        Returns:
            A list of lists of lists generator runs. Each outer list represents
            a trial being suggested and  each inner list represents a generator
            run for that trial.
