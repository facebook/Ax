        "`Analysis` protocol and its various subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Analysis classes implement a method `compute` which consumes an `Experiment`,\n",

        "which contains data to be rendered (ex. a plot), and miscellaneous metadata like\n",
        "a title, subtitle, and priority level used for sorting. `compute` returns a\n",
