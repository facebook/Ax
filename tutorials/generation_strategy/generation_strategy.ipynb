    "\n",
    "`GenerationStrategy` ([API reference](https://ax.dev/api/modelbridge.html#ax.modelbridge.generation_strategy.GenerationStrategy)) is a key abstraction in Ax:\n",
    "- It allows for specifying multiple optimization algorithms to chain one after another in the course of the optimization. \n",
    "- Many higher-level APIs in Ax use generation strategies: Service and Loop APIs, `Scheduler` etc. (tutorials for all those higher-level APIs are here: https://ax.dev/tutorials/).\n",
    "- Generation strategy allows for storage and resumption of modeling setups, making optimization resumable from SQL or JSON snapshots.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks through a few examples of generation strategies and discusses its important settings. Before reading it, we recommend familiarizing yourself with how `Model` and `ModelBridge` work in Ax: https://ax.dev/docs/models.html#deeper-dive-organization-of-the-modeling-stack.\n",

    "2. Deep dive: `GenerationStep` a building block of the generation strategy\n",
    "   1. Describing a model\n",
    "   2. Other `GenerationStep` settings\n",
    "   3. Chaining `GenerationStep`-s together\n",

    "3. `GenerationStrategy` storage\n",
    "   1. JSON storage\n",
    "   2. SQL storage\n",
    "4. Advanced considerations / \"gotchas\"\n",
    "   1. Generation strategy produces `GeneratorRun`-s, not `Trial`-s\n",
    "   2. `model_kwargs` elements that don't have associated serialization logic in Ax\n",

    "\n",
    "Since `GenerationStrategy.gen` mimics `ModelBridge.gen` and allows for human-in-the-loop usage mode, a call to `gen` produces a `GeneratorRun`, which can then be added (or altered before addition or not added at all) to a `Trial` or `BatchTrial` on a given experiment. So it's important to add the generator run to a trial, since otherwise it will not be attached to the experiment on its own."
