        "# Automating Orchestration\n",
        "Previously, we've demonstrated [using Ax for ask-tell optimization](../getting_started), a paradigm in which we \"ask\" Ax for candidate configurations and \"tell\" Ax our observations.\n",
        "This can be effective in many scenerios, and it can be automated through use of flow control statements like `for` and `while` loops.\n",
        "However there are some situations where it would be beneficial to allow Ax to orchestrate the entire optimization: deploying trials to external systems, polling their status, and reading reading their results.\n",
        "This can be common in a number of real world engineering tasks, including:\n",
        "* **Large scale machine learning experiments** running workloads on high-performance computing clusters\n",
        "* **A/B tests** conducted using an external experimentation platform\n",
        "* **Materials science** optimizations utilizing a self-driving laboratory\n",
        "\n",
        "Ax's `Client` can orchestrate automated adaptive experiments like this using its method `run_trials`.\n",
        "Users create custom classes which implement Ax's `IMetric` and `IRunner` protocols to handle data fetching and trial deployment respectively.\n",
        "Then, users simply configure their `Client` as they would normally and call `run_trials`; Ax will deploy trials, fetch data, generate candidates, and repeat as necessary.\n",
        "Ax can manage complex orchestration tasks including launching multiple trials in parallel while still respecting a user-defined concurrency limit, and gracefully handling trial failure by allowing the experiment to continue even if some trials do not complete successfully or data fetching fails.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial we will optimize the Hartmann6 function as before, but we will configure custom Runners and Metrics to mimic an external execution system.\n",
        "The Runner will calculate Hartmann6 with the appropriate parameters, write the result to a file, and tell Ax the trial is ready after 5 seconds.\n",
        "The Metric will find the appropriate file and report the results back to Ax.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning Objectives\n",
        "* Learn when it can be appropriate and/or advantageous to run Ax in a closed-loop\n",
        "* Configure custom Runners and Metrics, allowing Ax to deploy trials and fetch data automatically\n",
        "* Understand tradeoffs between parallelism and optimization performance\n",
        "\n",
        "### Prerequisites\n",
        "* Understanding of [adaptive experimentation](../../intro-to-ae.mdx) and [Bayesian optimization](../../intro-to-bo.mdx)\n",
