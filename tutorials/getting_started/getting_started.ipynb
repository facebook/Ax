        "Complex optimization problems where we wish to tune multiple parameters to improve metric performance, but the inter-parameter interactions are not fully understood, are common across various fields including machine learning, robotics, materials science, and chemistry.\n",
        "This category of problem is known as \"black-box\" optimization.\n",
        "The complexity of black-box optimization problems further increases if evaluations are expensive to conduct, time-consuming, or noisy.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use Ax to efficiently conduct an experiment in which we \"ask\" for candidate points to evaluate, \"tell\" Ax the results, and repeat.\n",
        "We'll uses Ax's `Client`, a tool for managing the state of our experiment, and we'll learn how to define an optimization problem, configure an experiment, run trials, analyze results, and persist the experiment for later use using the `Client`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because Ax is a black box optimizer, we can use it to optimize any arbitrary function. In this example we will minimize the [Hartmann6 function](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/hart6.html), a complicated 6-dimensional function with multiple local minima.\n",
        "Hartmann6 is a challenging benchmark for optimization algorithms commonly used in the global optimization literature -- it tests the algorithm's ability to identify the true global minimum, rather than mistakenly converging on a local minimum.\n",
        "Looking at its analytic form we can see that it would be incredibly challenging to efficiently find the global minimum either by manual trial-and-error or traditional design of experiments like grid-search or random-search.\n",
