## Building

You need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 8.x and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) >= 1.5
in order to build the Ax website.

Switch to the `website` dir from the project root and start the server:

```
cd website
yarn & yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (if doesn't automatically open).

Anytime you change the contents of the page, the page should auto-update.

## Publishing
The site is hosted as a GitHub page. Once Ax is live, we will generate a static
site and automatically push the output to the `gh-pages` branch via CircleCI.
