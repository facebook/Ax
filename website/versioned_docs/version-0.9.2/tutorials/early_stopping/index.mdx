## Trial-level early stopping in Ax

This tutorial illustrates how to add a trial-level early stopping strategy to an Ax
hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) loop. The goal of trial-level early stopping is to
monitor the results of expensive evaluations and terminate those that are unlikely to
produce promising results, freeing up resources to explore more configurations.

Most of this tutorial is adapted from the
[PyTorch Ax Multiobjective NAS Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ax_multiobjective_nas_tutorial.html).
The training job is different from the original in that we do not optimize `batch_size`
or `epochs`. This was done for illustrative purposes, as each validation curve now has
the same number of points. The companion training file `mnist_train_nas.py` has also
been altered to log to Tensorboard during training.

NOTE: Although the original NAS tutorial is for a multi-objective problem, this tutorial
focuses on a single objective (validation accuracy) problem. Early stopping currently
does not support "true" multi-objective stopping, although one can use
[logical compositions of early stopping strategies](https://github.com/facebook/Ax/blob/main/ax/early_stopping/strategies/logical.py)
to target multiple objectives separately. Early stopping for the multi-objective case is
currently a work in progress.

```

## Defining the TorchX App

Our goal is to optimize the PyTorch Lightning training job defined in
[mnist_train_nas.py](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/tree/master/intermediate_source/mnist_train_nas.py)_.
To do this using TorchX, we write a helper function that takes in the values of the
architcture and hyperparameters of the training job and creates a
[TorchX AppDef](https://pytorch.org/torchx/latest/basics.html)_ with the appropriate
settings.

```python
if SMOKE_TEST:
    epochs = 3
else:
    epochs = 10
```

```python
def trainer(
    log_path: str,
    hidden_size_1: int,
    hidden_size_2: int,
    learning_rate: float,
    dropout: float,
    trial_idx: int = -1,
) -> specs.AppDef:

    # define the log path so we can pass it to the TorchX AppDef
    if trial_idx >= 0:
        log_path = Path(log_path).joinpath(str(trial_idx)).absolute().as_posix()

    batch_size = 32

    return utils.python(
        # command line args to the training script
        "--log_path",
        log_path,
        "--hidden_size_1",
        str(hidden_size_1),
        "--hidden_size_2",
        str(hidden_size_2),
        "--learning_rate",
        str(learning_rate),
        "--epochs",
        str(epochs),
        "--dropout",
        str(dropout),
        "--batch_size",
        str(batch_size),
        # other config options
        name="trainer",
        script="tutorials/early_stopping/mnist_train_nas.py",
        image=torchx.version.TORCHX_IMAGE,
    )
```

## Setting up the Runner

Ax’s [Runner](https://ax.dev/api/core.html#ax.core.runner.Runner) abstraction allows
writing interfaces to various backends. Ax already comes with Runner for TorchX, so we
just need to configure it. For the purpose of this tutorial, we run jobs locally in a
fully asynchronous fashion. In order to launch them on a cluster, you can instead
specify a different TorchX scheduler and adjust the configuration appropriately. For
example, if you have a Kubernetes cluster, you just need to change the scheduler from
`local_cwd` to `kubernetes`.

The training job launched by this runner will log partial results to Tensorboard, which
will then be monitored by the early stopping strategy. We will show how this is done
using an Ax
[TensorboardMetric](https://ax.dev/api/metrics.html#module-ax.metrics.tensorboard)
below.

```python
# Make a temporary dir to log our results into
log_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()

ax_runner = TorchXRunner(
    tracker_base="/tmp/",
    component=trainer,
    # NOTE: To launch this job on a cluster instead of locally you can
    # specify a different scheduler and adjust args appropriately.
    scheduler="local_cwd",
    component_const_params={"log_path": log_dir},
    cfg={},
)
```

## Setting up the SearchSpace

First, we define our search space. Ax supports both range parameters of type integer and
float as well as choice parameters which can have non-numerical types such as strings.
We will tune the hidden sizes, learning rate, and dropout parameters.

```python
parameters = [
    # NOTE: In a real-world setting, hidden_size_1 and hidden_size_2
    # should probably be powers of 2, but in our simple example this
    # would mean that num_params can't take on that many values, which
    # in turn makes the Pareto frontier look pretty weird.
    RangeParameter(
        name="hidden_size_1",
        lower=16,
        upper=128,
        parameter_type=ParameterType.INT,
        log_scale=True,
    ),
    RangeParameter(
        name="hidden_size_2",
        lower=16,
        upper=128,
        parameter_type=ParameterType.INT,
        log_scale=True,
    ),
    RangeParameter(
        name="learning_rate",
        lower=1e-4,
        upper=1e-2,
        parameter_type=ParameterType.FLOAT,
        log_scale=True,
    ),
    RangeParameter(
        name="dropout",
        lower=0.0,
        upper=0.5,
        parameter_type=ParameterType.FLOAT,
    ),
]

search_space = SearchSpace(
    parameters=parameters,
    # NOTE: In practice, it may make sense to add a constraint
    # hidden_size_2 <= hidden_size_1
    parameter_constraints=[],
)
```

## Setting up Metrics

Ax has the concept of a Metric that defines properties of outcomes and how observations
are obtained for these outcomes. This allows e.g. encodig how data is fetched from some
distributed execution backend and post-processed before being passed as input to Ax.

We will optimize the validation accuracy, which is a `TensorboardMetric` that points to
the logging directory assigned above. Note that we have set
`is_available_while_running`, allowing for the metric to be queried as the trial
progresses. This is critical for the early stopping strategy to monitor partial results.

```python
class MyTensorboardMetric(TensorboardMetric):

    # NOTE: We need to tell the new Tensorboard metric how to get the id /
    # file handle for the tensorboard logs from a trial. In this case
    # our convention is to just save a separate file per trial in
    # the pre-specified log dir.
    def _get_event_multiplexer_for_trial(self, trial):
        mul = event_multiplexer.EventMultiplexer(max_reload_threads=20)
        mul.AddRunsFromDirectory(Path(log_dir).joinpath(str(trial.index)).as_posix(), None)
        mul.Reload()

        return mul

    # This indicates whether the metric is queryable while the trial is
    # still running. This is required for early stopping to monitor the
    # progress of the running trial.ArithmeticError
    @classmethod
    def is_available_while_running(cls):
        return True
```

```python
val_acc = MyTensorboardMetric(
    name="val_acc",
    tag="val_acc",
    lower_is_better=False,
)
```

## Setting up the OptimizationConfig

The `OptimizationConfig` specifies the objective for Ax to optimize.

```python
opt_config = OptimizationConfig(
    objective=Objective(
        metric=val_acc,
        minimize=False,
    )
)
```

## Defining an Early Stopping Strategy

A `PercentileEarlyStoppingStrategy` is a simple method that stops a trial if its
performance falls below a certain percentile of other trials at the same step (e.g.,
when `percentile_threshold` is 50, at a given point in time, if a trial ranks in the
bottom 50% of trials, it is stopped).

- We make use of `normalize_progressions` which normalizes the progression column (e.g.
  timestamp, epochs, training data used) to be in [0, 1]. This is useful because one
  doesn't need to know the maximum progression values of the curve (which might be,
  e.g., the total number of data points in the training dataset).
- The `min_progression` parameter specifies that trials should only be considered for
  stopping if the latest progression value is greater than this threshold.
- The `min_curves` parameter specifies the minimum number of completed curves (i.e.,
  fully completed training jobs) before early stopping will be considered. This should
  be larger than zero if `normalize_progression` is used. In general, we want a few
  completed curves to have a baseline for comparison.

Note that `PercentileEarlyStoppingStrategy` does not make use of learning curve modeling
or prediction. More sophisticated model-based methods will be available in future
versions of Ax.

```python
percentile_early_stopping_strategy = PercentileEarlyStoppingStrategy(
    # stop if in bottom 70% of runs at the same progression
    percentile_threshold=70,
    # the trial must have passed `min_progression` steps before early stopping is initiated
    # note that we are using `normalize_progressions`, so this is on a scale of [0, 1]
    min_progression=0.3,
    # there must be `min_curves` completed trials and `min_curves` trials reporting data in
    # order for early stopping to be applicable
    min_curves=5,
    # specify, e.g., [0, 1] if the first two trials should never be stopped
    trial_indices_to_ignore=None,
    # check for new data every 10 seconds
    seconds_between_polls=10,
    normalize_progressions=True,
)
```

## Creating the Ax Experiment

In Ax, the Experiment object is the object that stores all the information about the
problem setup.

```python
experiment = Experiment(
    name="torchx_mnist",
    search_space=search_space,
    optimization_config=opt_config,
    runner=ax_runner,
)
```

## Choosing the GenerationStrategy

A
[GenerationStrategy](https://ax.dev/api/modelbridge.html#ax.modelbridge.generation_strategy.GenerationStrategy)
is the abstract representation of how we would like to perform the optimization. While
this can be customized (if you’d like to do so, see
[this tutorial](https://ax.dev/tutorials/generation_strategy.html)), in most cases Ax
can automatically determine an appropriate strategy based on the search space,
optimization config, and the total number of trials we want to run.

Typically, Ax chooses to evaluate a number of random configurations before starting a
model-based Bayesian Optimization strategy.

We remark that in Ax, generation strategies and early stopping strategies are separate,
a design decision motivated by ease-of-use. However, we should acknowledge that jointly
considering generation and stopping using a single strategy would likely be the "proper"
formulation.

```python
if SMOKE_TEST:
    total_trials = 6
else:
    total_trials = 15  # total evaluation budget

gs = choose_generation_strategy(
    search_space=experiment.search_space,
    optimization_config=experiment.optimization_config,
    num_trials=total_trials,
)
```

## Configuring the Scheduler

The `Scheduler` acts as the loop control for the optimization. It communicates with the
backend to launch trials, check their status, retrieve (partial) results, and
importantly for this tutorial, calls the early stopping strategy. If the early stopping
strategy suggests a trial to be the stopped, the `Scheduler` communicates with the
backend to terminate the trial.

The `Scheduler` requires the `Experiment` and the `GenerationStrategy`. A set of options
can be passed in via `SchedulerOptions`. Here, we configure the number of total
evaluations as well as `max_pending_trials`, the maximum number of trials that should
run concurrently. In our local setting, this is the number of training jobs running as
individual processes, while in a remote execution setting, this would be the number of
machines you want to use in parallel.

```python
scheduler = Scheduler(
    experiment=experiment,
    generation_strategy=gs,
    options=SchedulerOptions(
        total_trials=total_trials,
        max_pending_trials=5,
        early_stopping_strategy=percentile_early_stopping_strategy,
    ),
)

## Results

First, we examine the data stored on the experiment. This shows that each trial is
associated with an entire learning curve, represented by the column "steps".

We can give a very rough estimate of the amount of computational savings due to early
stopping, by looking at the total number of steps used when early stopping is used
versus the number of steps used if we ran all trials to completion. Note to do a true
comparison, one should run full HPO loops with and without early stopping (as early
stopping will influence the model and future points selected by the generation
strategy).

```python
map_df = experiment.lookup_data().map_df
trial_to_max_steps = map_df.groupby("trial_index")["step"].max()
completed_trial_steps = trial_to_max_steps.iloc[0]
savings = 1.0 - trial_to_max_steps.sum() / (
    completed_trial_steps * len(trial_to_max_steps)
)
# TODO format nicer
print(f"A rough estimate of the computational savings is {100 * savings}%.")
```

## Visualizations

Finally, we show a visualization of learning curves versus actual elapsed wall time.
This helps to illustrate that stopped trials make room for additional trials to be run.

```python
# helper function for getting trial start times
def time_started(row):
    trial_index = row["trial_index"]
    return experiment.trials[trial_index].time_run_started


# helper function for getting trial completion times
def time_completed(row):
    trial_index = row["trial_index"]
    return experiment.trials[trial_index].time_completed


# helper function for getting relevant data from experiment
# with early stopping into useful dfs
def early_stopping_exp_to_df(experiment):
    trials_df = exp_to_df(experiment)
    curve_df = experiment.lookup_data().map_df
    training_row_df = (
        curve_df.groupby("trial_index").max().reset_index()[["trial_index", "steps"]]
    )
    trials_df = trials_df.merge(training_row_df, on="trial_index")
    trials_df["time_started"] = trials_df.apply(func=time_started, axis=1)
    trials_df["time_completed"] = trials_df.apply(func=time_completed, axis=1)
    start_time = trials_df["time_started"].min()
    trials_df["time_started_rel"] = (
        trials_df["time_started"] - start_time
    ).dt.total_seconds()
    trials_df["time_completed_rel"] = (
        trials_df["time_completed"] - start_time
    ).dt.total_seconds()
    return trials_df, curve_df


def plot_curves_by_wall_time(trials_df, curve_df):
    trials = set(curve_df["trial_index"])
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 6))
    ax.set(xlabel="seconds since start", ylabel="validation accuracy")
    for trial_index in trials:
        this_trial_df = curve_df[curve_df["trial_index"] == trial_index]
        start_time_rel = trials_df["time_started_rel"].iloc[trial_index]
        completed_time_rel = trials_df["time_completed_rel"].iloc[trial_index]
        total_steps = trials_df.loc[trial_index, "steps"]
        smoothed_curve = this_trial_df["mean"].rolling(window=3).mean()
        x = (
            start_time_rel
            + (completed_time_rel - start_time_rel)
            / total_steps
            * this_trial_df["steps"]
        )
        ax.plot(
            x,
            smoothed_curve,
            label=f"trial #{trial_index}" if trial_index % 2 == 1 else None,
        )
    ax.legend()
```

```python
# wrap in try/except in case of flaky I/O issues
try:
    trials_df, curve_df = early_stopping_exp_to_df(experiment)
    plot_curves_by_wall_time(trials_df, curve_df)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Encountered exception while plotting results: {e}")
