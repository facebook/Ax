# Trial-level early stopping

Trial-level early stopping aims to monitor the results of expensive evaluations with
timeseries-like data and terminate those that are unlikely to produce promising results
prior to completing that evaluation. This reduces computational waste, and enables the
same amount of resources to explore more configurations. Early stopping is useful for
expensive to evaluate problems where stepwise information is available on the way to the
final measurement.

Like the [Getting Started tutorial](../getting_started) we'll be minimizing the
Hartmann6 function, but this time we've modified it to incorporate a new parameter $t$
which allows the function to produce timeseries-like data where the value returned is
closer and closer to Hartmann6's true value as $t$ increases. At $t = 100$ the function
will simply return Hartmann6's unaltered value.

$$

f(x, t) = hartmann6(x) - log_2(t/100)

$$

While the function is synthetic, the workflow captures the intended principles for this
tutorial and is similar to the process of training typical machine learning models.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand when time-series-like data can be used in an optimization experiment
- Run a simple optimization experiment with early stopping
- Configure details of an early stopping strategy
- Analyze the results of the optimization

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Python and basic programming concepts
- Understanding of [adaptive experimentation](../../intro-to-ae.mdx) and
  [Bayesian optimization](../../intro-to-bo.mdx)
- [Getting Started with Ax](../getting_started/index.mdx)

## Step 1: Import Necessary Modules

First, ensure you have all the necessary imports:

```python
import numpy as np
from ax.api.client import Client
from ax.api.configs import  RangeParameterConfig
```

## Step 2: Initialize the Client

Create an instance of the `Client` to manage the state of your experiment.

```python
client = Client()
```

## Step 3: Configure the Experiment

The `Client` instance can be configured with a series of `Config`s that define how the
experiment will be run.

The Hartmann6 problem is usually evaluated on the hypercube $x_i \in (0, 1)$, so we will
define six identical `RangeParameterConfig`s with these bounds.

You may specify additional features like parameter constraints to further refine the
search space and parameter scaling to help navigate parameters with nonuniform effects.

```python
# Define six float parameters for the Hartmann6 function
parameters = [
    RangeParameterConfig(
        name=f"x{i + 1}", parameter_type="float", bounds=(0, 1)
    )
    for i in range(6)
]

client.configure_experiment(parameters=parameters)
```

## Step 4: Configure Optimization

Now, we must configure the objective for this optimization, which we do using
`Client.configure_optimization`. This method expects a string `objective`, an expression
containing either a single metric to maximize, a linear combination of metrics to
maximize, or a tuple of multiple metrics to jointly maximize. These expressions are
parsed using [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html). For example:

- `"score"` would direct Ax to maximize a metric named score
- `"-loss"` would direct Ax to Ax to minimize a metric named loss
- `"task_0 + 0.5 * task_1"` would direct Ax to maximize the sum of two task scores,
  downweighting task_1 by a factor of 0.5
- `"score, -flops"` would direct Ax to simultaneously maximize score while minimizing
  flops

See these recipes for more information on configuring
[objectives](../../recipes/multi-objective-optimization) and
[outcome constraints](../../recipes/outcome-constraints).

```python
client.configure_optimization(objective="-hartmann6")
```

## Step 5: Run Trials with early stopping

Here, we will configure the ask-tell loop.

We begin by defining our Hartmann6 function as written above. Remember, this is just an
example problem and any Python function can be substituted here.

Then we will iteratively do the following:

- Call `client.get_next_trials` to "ask" Ax for a parameterization to evaluate
- Evaluate `hartmann6_curve` using those parameters in an inner loop to simulate the
  generation of timeseries data
- "Tell" Ax the partial result using `client.attach_data`
- Query whether the trial should be stopped via `client.should_stop_trial_early`
- Stop the underperforming trial and report back to Ax that is has been stopped

This loop will run multiple trials to optimize the function.

Ax will configure an EarlyStoppingStrategy when `should_stop_trial_early` is called for
the first time. By default Ax uses a Percentile early stopping strategy which will
terminate a trial early if its performance falls below a percentile threshold when
compared to other trials at the same step. Early stopping can only occur after a minimum
number of `progressions` to prevent premature early stopping. This validates that both
enough data is gathered to make a decision and there is a minimum number of completed
trials with curve data; these completed trials establish a baseline.

```python
# Hartmann6 function
def hartmann6(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6):
    alpha = np.array([1.0, 1.2, 3.0, 3.2])

            [17, 8, 0.05, 10, 0.1, 14],
        ]
    )
    P = 10**-4 * np.array(

            [4047, 8828, 8732, 5743, 1091, 381],
        ]
    )

    outer = 0.0
    for i in range(4):
        inner = 0.0
        for j, x in enumerate([x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6]):
            inner += A[i, j] * (x - P[i, j]) ** 2
        outer += alpha[i] * np.exp(-inner)
    return -outer


# Hartmann6 function with additional t term such that
# hartmann6(X) == hartmann6_curve(X, t=100)
def hartmann6_curve(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, t):
    return hartmann6(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6) - np.log2(t / 100)

## Step 6: Analyze Results

After running trials, you can analyze the results. Most commonly this means extracting
the parameterization from the best performing trial you conducted.

```python
best_parameters, prediction, index, name = client.get_best_parameterization()
print("Best Parameters:", best_parameters)
print("Prediction (mean, variance):", prediction)
```

<CellOutput>
{
`Best Parameters: {'x1': 0.2205635216087103, 'x2': 0.4097360987216234, 'x3': 0.5463940855115652, 'x4': 0.02734966855496168, 'x5': 0.5727605344727635, 'x6': 0.646769386716187}
Prediction (mean, variance): {'hartmann6': (np.float64(-1.0093598018033862), np.float64(0.00011000295320041834))}`
}
</CellOutput>

## Step 7: Compute Analyses

Ax can also produce a number of analyses to help interpret the results of the experiment
via `client.compute_analyses`. Users can manually select which analyses to run, or can
allow Ax to select which would be most relevant. In this case Ax selects the following:

- **Arm Effects Plots** show the metric value for each
  [arm](https://ax.dev/docs/next/glossary#arm) on the experiment. Ax produces one plot
  using values from its internal surrogate model (this can be helpful for seeing the
  true effect of an arm when evaluations are noisy) and another using the raw metric
  values as observed.
- **Summary** lists all trials generated along with their parameterizations,
  observations, and miscellaneous metadata
- **Sensitivity Analysis Plot** shows which parameters have the largest affect on the
  objective using
  [Sobol Indicies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance-based_sensitivity_analysis)
- **Slice Plot** shows how the model predicts a single parameter effects the objective
  along with a confidence interval
- **Contour Plot** shows how the model predicts a pair of parameters effects the
  objective as a 2D surface
- **Cross Validation** helps to visualize how well the surrogate model is able to
  predict out of sample points

```python
# display=True instructs Ax to sort then render the resulting analyses
cards = client.compute_analyses(display=True)
```

**Modeled Arm Effects on hartmann6**

Modeled effects on hartmann6. This plot visualizes predictions of the true metric
changes for each arm based on Ax's model. This is the expected delta you would expect if
you (re-)ran that arm. This plot helps in anticipating the outcomes and performance of
arms based on the model's predictions. Note, flat predictions across arms indicate that
the model predicts that there is no effect, meaning if you were to re-run the
experiment, the delta you would see would be small and fall within the confidence
interval indicated in the plot.

**Observed Arm Effects on hartmann6**

Observed effects on hartmann6. This plot visualizes the effects from previously-run arms
on a specific metric, providing insights into their performance. This plot allows one to
compare and contrast the effectiveness of different arms, highlighting which
configurations have yielded the most favorable outcomes.

**Cross Validation for hartmann6**

The cross-validation plot displays the model fit for each metric in the experiment. It
employs a leave-one-out approach, where the model is trained on all data except one
sample, which is used for validation. The plot shows the predicted outcome for the
validation set on the y-axis against its actual value on the x-axis. Points that align
closely with the dotted diagonal line indicate a strong model fit, signifying accurate
predictions. Additionally, the plot includes 95% confidence intervals that provide
insight into the noise in observations and the uncertainty in model predictions. A
horizontal, flat line of predictions indicates that the model has not picked up on
sufficient signal in the data, and instead is just predicting the mean.

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstates Ax's early stopping capabilities, which utilize
timeseries-like data to monitor the results of expensive evaluations and terminate those
that are unlikely to produce promising results, freeing up resources to explore more
configurations. This can be used in a number of applications, and is especially useful
in machine learning contexts.
