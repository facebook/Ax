# Configurable closed-loop optimization with Ax `Scheduler`

*We recommend reading through the
["Developer API" tutorial](https://ax.dev/tutorials/gpei_hartmann_developer.html) before
getting started with the `Scheduler`, as using it in this tutorial will require an Ax
`Experiment` and an understanding of the experiment's subcomponents like the search
space and the runner.*

### Contents:

1. **Scheduler and external systems for trial evalution** –– overview of how scheduler
   works with an external system to run a closed-loop optimization.

   will be used to illustrate a scheduler setup in this tutorial.
1. **Set up an experiment according to the mock external system** –– set up a runner
   that deploys trials to the dummy external system from part 2 and a metric that
   fetches trial results from that system, then leverage those runner and metric and set
   up an experiment.

   1. Using `Scheduler.run_trials_and_yield_results` to run the optimization via a
      generator method.

## 1. `Scheduler` and external systems for trial evaluation

`Scheduler` is a closed-loop manager class in Ax that continuously deploys trial runs to
an arbitrary external system in an asynchronous fashion, polls their status from that
system, and leverages known trial results to generate more trials.

Key features of the `Scheduler`:

- Maintains user-set concurrency limits for trials run in parallel, keep track of
  tolerated level of failed trial runs, and 'oversee' the optimization in other ways,
- Leverages an Ax `Experiment` for optimization setup (an optimization config with
  metrics, a search space, a runner for trial evaluations),
- Uses an Ax `GenerationStrategy` for flexible specification of an optimization
  algorithm used to generate new trials to run,
- Supports SQL storage and allows for easy resumption of stored experiments.

This scheme summarizes how the scheduler interacts with any external system used to run
trial evaluations:

## 2. Set up a mock external execution system

An example of an 'external system' running trial evaluations could be a remote server
executing scheduled jobs, a subprocess conducting ML training runs, an engine running
physics simulations, etc. For the sake of example here, let us assume a dummy external
system with the following client:

```python
from random import randint
from time import time
from typing import Any, Dict, NamedTuple, Union

from ax.core.base_trial import TrialStatus
from ax.utils.measurement.synthetic_functions import branin


class MockJob(NamedTuple):
    """Dummy class to represent a job scheduled on `MockJobQueue`."""

    id: int
    parameters: Dict[str, Union[str, float, int, bool]]


class MockJobQueueClient:
    """Dummy class to represent a job queue where the Ax `Scheduler` will
    deploy trial evaluation runs during optimization.
    """

    jobs: Dict[str, MockJob] = {}

    def schedule_job_with_parameters(
        self, parameters: Dict[str, Union[str, float, int, bool]]
    ) -> int:
        """Schedules an evaluation job with given parameters and returns job ID."""
        # Code to actually schedule the job and produce an ID would go here;
        # using timestamp in microseconds as dummy ID for this example.
        job_id = int(time() * 1e6)
        self.jobs[job_id] = MockJob(job_id, parameters)
        return job_id

    def get_job_status(self, job_id: int) -> TrialStatus:
        """ "Get status of the job by a given ID. For simplicity of the example,
        return an Ax `TrialStatus`.
        """
        job = self.jobs[job_id]
        # Instead of randomizing trial status, code to check actual job status
        # would go here.
        if randint(0, 3) > 0:
            return TrialStatus.COMPLETED
        return TrialStatus.RUNNING

    def get_outcome_value_for_completed_job(self, job_id: int) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Get evaluation results for a given completed job."""
        job = self.jobs[job_id]
        # In a real external system, this would retrieve real relevant outcomes and
        # not a synthetic function value.
        return {"branin": branin(job.parameters.get("x1"), job.parameters.get("x2"))}


MOCK_JOB_QUEUE_CLIENT = MockJobQueueClient()


def get_mock_job_queue_client() -> MockJobQueueClient:
    """Obtain the singleton job queue instance."""
    return MOCK_JOB_QUEUE_CLIENT
```

## 3. Set up an experiment according to the mock external system

As mentioned above, using a `Scheduler` requires a fully set up experiment with metrics
and a runner. Refer to the "Building Blocks of Ax" tutorial to learn more about those
components, as here we assume familiarity with them.

The following runner and metric set up intractions between the `Scheduler` and the mock
external system we assume:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import Iterable, Set

from ax.core.base_trial import BaseTrial
from ax.core.runner import Runner
from ax.core.trial import Trial


class MockJobRunner(Runner):  # Deploys trials to external system.
    def run(self, trial: BaseTrial) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Deploys a trial based on custom runner subclass implementation.

        Args:
            trial: The trial to deploy.

        Returns:
            Dict of run metadata from the deployment process.
        """
        if not isinstance(trial, Trial):
            raise ValueError("This runner only handles `Trial`.")

        mock_job_queue = get_mock_job_queue_client()
        job_id = mock_job_queue.schedule_job_with_parameters(
            parameters=trial.arm.parameters
        )
        # This run metadata will be attached to trial as `trial.run_metadata`
        # by the base `Scheduler`.
        return {"job_id": job_id}

    def poll_trial_status(
        self, trials: Iterable[BaseTrial]
    ) -> Dict[TrialStatus, Set[int]]:
        """Checks the status of any non-terminal trials and returns their
        indices as a mapping from TrialStatus to a list of indices. Required
        for runners used with Ax ``Scheduler``.

        NOTE: Does not need to handle waiting between polling calls while trials
        are running; this function should just perform a single poll.

        Args:
            trials: Trials to poll.

        Returns:
            A dictionary mapping TrialStatus to a list of trial indices that have
            the respective status at the time of the polling. This does not need to
            include trials that at the time of polling already have a terminal
            (ABANDONED, FAILED, COMPLETED) status (but it may).
        """
        status_dict = defaultdict(set)
        for trial in trials:
            mock_job_queue = get_mock_job_queue_client()
            status = mock_job_queue.get_job_status(
                job_id=trial.run_metadata.get("job_id")
            )
            status_dict[status].add(trial.index)

        return status_dict
```

```python
import pandas as pd

from ax.core.metric import Metric, MetricFetchResult, MetricFetchE
from ax.core.base_trial import BaseTrial
from ax.core.data import Data
from ax.utils.common.result import Ok, Err


class BraninForMockJobMetric(Metric):  # Pulls data for trial from external system.
    def fetch_trial_data(self, trial: BaseTrial) -> MetricFetchResult:
        """Obtains data via fetching it from ` for a given trial."""
        if not isinstance(trial, Trial):
            raise ValueError("This metric only handles `Trial`.")

        try:
            mock_job_queue = get_mock_job_queue_client()

            # Here we leverage the "job_id" metadata created by `MockJobRunner.run`.
            branin_data = mock_job_queue.get_outcome_value_for_completed_job(
                job_id=trial.run_metadata.get("job_id")
            )
            df_dict = {
                "trial_index": trial.index,
                "metric_name": "branin",
                "arm_name": trial.arm.name,
                "mean": branin_data.get("branin"),
                # Can be set to 0.0 if function is known to be noiseless
                # or to an actual value when SEM is known. Setting SEM to
                # `None` results in Ax assuming unknown noise and inferring
                # noise level from data.
                "sem": None,
            }
            return Ok(value=Data(df=pd.DataFrame.from_records([df_dict])))
        except Exception as e:
            return Err(
                MetricFetchE(message=f"Failed to fetch {self.name}", exception=e)
            )
```

Now we can set up the experiment using the runner and metric we defined. This experiment
will have a single-objective optimization config, minimizing the Branin function, and
the search space that corresponds to that function.

```python
from ax import *


def make_branin_experiment_with_runner_and_metric() -> Experiment:
    parameters = [
        RangeParameter(
            name="x1",
            parameter_type=ParameterType.FLOAT,
            lower=-5,
            upper=10,
        ),
        RangeParameter(
            name="x2",
            parameter_type=ParameterType.FLOAT,
            lower=0,
            upper=15,
        ),
    ]

    objective = Objective(metric=BraninForMockJobMetric(name="branin"), minimize=True)

    return Experiment(
        name="branin_test_experiment",
        search_space=SearchSpace(parameters=parameters),
        optimization_config=OptimizationConfig(objective=objective),
        runner=MockJobRunner(),
        is_test=True,  # Marking this experiment as a test experiment.
    )


experiment = make_branin_experiment_with_runner_and_metric()
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:22] ax.core.experiment: The is_test flag has been set to True. This flag is meant purely for development and integration testing purposes. If you are running a live experiment, please set this flag to False`
}
</CellOutput>

## 4. Setting up a `Scheduler`

### 4A. Auto-selecting a generation strategy

A `Scheduler` requires an Ax `GenerationStrategy` specifying the algorithm to use for
the optimization. Here we use the `choose_generation_strategy` utility that auto-picks a
generation strategy based on the search space properties. To construct a custom
generation strategy instead, refer to the
["Generation Strategy" tutorial](https://ax.dev/tutorials/generation_strategy.html).

Importantly, a generation strategy in Ax limits allowed parallelism levels for each
generation step it contains. If you would like the `Scheduler` to ensure parallelism
limitations, set `max_examples` on each generation step in your generation strategy.

```python
from ax.modelbridge.dispatch_utils import choose_generation_strategy

generation_strategy = choose_generation_strategy(
    search_space=experiment.search_space,
    max_parallelism_cap=3,
)
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:22] ax.modelbridge.dispatch_utils: Using Models.BOTORCH_MODULAR since there is at least one ordered parameter and there are no unordered categorical parameters.`
}
</CellOutput>


<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:22] ax.modelbridge.dispatch_utils: Calculating the number of remaining initialization trials based on num_initialization_trials=None max_initialization_trials=None num_tunable_parameters=2 num_trials=None use_batch_trials=False`
}
</CellOutput>


<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:22] ax.modelbridge.dispatch_utils: calculated num_initialization_trials=5`
}
</CellOutput>


<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:22] ax.modelbridge.dispatch_utils: num_completed_initialization_trials=0 num_remaining_initialization_trials=5`
}
</CellOutput>


<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:22] ax.modelbridge.dispatch_utils: verbose, disable_progbar, and jit_compile are not yet supported when using choose_generation_strategy with ModularBoTorchModel, dropping these arguments.`
}
</CellOutput>


<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:22] ax.modelbridge.dispatch_utils: Using Bayesian Optimization generation strategy: GenerationStrategy(name='Sobol+BoTorch', steps=[Sobol for 5 trials, BoTorch for subsequent trials]). Iterations after 5 will take longer to generate due to model-fitting.`
}
</CellOutput>

Now we have all the components needed to start the scheduler:

```python
from ax.service.scheduler import Scheduler, SchedulerOptions


scheduler = Scheduler(
    experiment=experiment,
    generation_strategy=generation_strategy,
    options=SchedulerOptions(),
)
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:22] Scheduler: Scheduler requires experiment to have immutable search space and optimization config. Setting property immutable_search_space_and_opt_config to True on experiment.`
}
</CellOutput>

### 4B. Optional: Defining a plotting function

```python

```

```python
import numpy as np
from ax.plot.trace import optimization_trace_single_method
from ax.utils.notebook.plotting import render, init_notebook_plotting

init_notebook_plotting()


def get_plot():
    best_objectives = np.array(
        [[trial.objective_mean for trial in scheduler.experiment.trials.values()]]
    )
    best_objective_plot = optimization_trace_single_method(
        y=np.minimum.accumulate(best_objectives, axis=1),
        title="Model performance vs. # of iterations",
        ylabel="Y",
    )
    return best_objective_plot
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:22] ax.utils.notebook.plotting: Injecting Plotly library into cell. Do not overwrite or delete cell.`
}
</CellOutput>


<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:22] ax.utils.notebook.plotting: Please see
    (https://ax.dev/tutorials/visualizations.html#Fix-for-plots-that-are-not-rendering)
    if visualizations are not rendering.`
}
</CellOutput>

## 5. Running the optimization

Once the `Scheduler` instance is set up, user can execute `run_n_trials` as many times
as needed, and each execution will add up to the specified `max_trials` trials to the
experiment. The number of trials actually run might be less than `max_trials` if the
optimization was concluded (e.g. there are no more points in the search space).

```python
scheduler.run_n_trials(max_trials=3)
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:22] Scheduler: Fetching data for newly completed trials: [].`

<CellOutput>
{

render(best_objective_plot)
```

<PlotlyFigure data={require('./assets/plot_data/be3ae634-55e2-46d1-ab9d-f7f878ddfeb3.json')} />

We can examine `experiment` to see that it now has three trials:

```python
from ax.service.utils.report_utils import exp_to_df

exp_to_df(experiment)
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `[WARNING 09-29 17:02:25] ax.service.utils.report_utils: Column reason missing for all trials. Not appending column.`
}
</CellOutput>



|    |   trial_index |   arm_name | trial_status   | generation_method   |   branin |       x1 |       x2 |
|---:|--------------:|-----------:|:---------------|:--------------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|

Now we can run `run_n_trials` again to add three more trials to the experiment (this
time, without plotting).

```python
scheduler.run_n_trials(max_trials=3)
```

Examiniming the experiment, we now see 6 trials, one of which is produced by Bayesian
optimization (GPEI):

```python
exp_to_df(experiment)
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `[WARNING 09-29 17:02:29] ax.service.utils.report_utils: Column reason missing for all trials. Not appending column.`

For each call to `run_n_trials`, one can specify a timeout; if `run_n_trials` has been
running for too long without finishing its `max_trials`, the operation will exit
gracefully:

```python
scheduler.run_n_trials(max_trials=3, timeout_hours=0.00001)
```

## 6. Leveraging SQL storage and experiment resumption

When a scheduler is SQL-enabled, it will automatically save all updates it makes to the
experiment in the course of the optimization. The experiment can then be resumed in the
event of a crash or after a pause. The scheduler should be stateless and therefore, the
scheduler itself is not saved in the database.

To store state of optimization to an SQL backend, first follow
[setup instructions](https://ax.dev/docs/storage.html#sql) on Ax website. Having set up
the SQL backend, pass `DBSettings` to the `Scheduler` on instantiation (note that
SQLAlchemy dependency will have to be installed – for installation, refer to
[optional dependencies](https://ax.dev/docs/installation.html#optional-dependencies) on
Ax website):

```python
from ax.storage.registry_bundle import RegistryBundle
from ax.storage.sqa_store.db import (
    create_all_tables,
    get_engine,
    init_engine_and_session_factory,

from ax.storage.sqa_store.encoder import Encoder
from ax.storage.sqa_store.sqa_config import SQAConfig
from ax.storage.sqa_store.structs import DBSettings

bundle = RegistryBundle(
    metric_clss={BraninForMockJobMetric: None}, runner_clss={MockJobRunner: None}
)

# URL is of the form "dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database".
# Instead of URL, can provide a `creator function`; can specify custom encoders/decoders if necessary.
db_settings = DBSettings(
    url="sqlite:///foo.db",
    encoder=bundle.encoder,
    decoder=bundle.decoder,
)

# The following lines are only necessary because it is the first time we are using this database
# in practice, you will not need to run these lines every time you initialize your scheduler
init_engine_and_session_factory(url=db_settings.url)
engine = get_engine()
create_all_tables(engine)

stored_experiment = make_branin_experiment_with_runner_and_metric()
generation_strategy = choose_generation_strategy(search_space=experiment.search_space)

scheduler_with_storage = Scheduler(
    experiment=stored_experiment,

## 7. Configuring the scheduler with `SchedulerOptions`, like early stopping

`Scheduler` exposes many options to configure the exact settings of the closed-loop
optimization to perform. A few notable ones are:

- `trial_type` –– currently only `Trial` and not `BatchTrial` is supported, but support
  for `BatchTrial`-s will follow,
- `tolerated_trial_failure_rate` and `min_failed_trials_for_failure_rate_check` ––
  together these two settings control how the scheduler monitors the failure rate among
  trial runs it deploys. Once `min_failed_trials_for_failure_rate_check` is deployed,
  the scheduler will start checking whether the ratio of failed to total trials is
  greater than `tolerated_trial_failure_rate`, and if it is, scheduler will exit the
  optimization with a `FailureRateExceededError`,
- `ttl_seconds_for_trials` –– sometimes a failure in a trial run means that it will be
  difficult to query its status (e.g. due to a crash). If this setting is specified, the
  Ax `Experiment` will automatically mark trials that have been running for too long
  (more than their 'time-to-live' (TTL) seconds) as failed,
- `run_trials_in_batches` –– if `True`, the scheduler will attempt to run trials not by
  calling `Scheduler.run_trial` in a loop, but by calling `Scheduler.run_trials` on all
  ready-to-deploy trials at once. This could allow for saving compute in cases where the
  deployment operation has large overhead and deploying many trials at once saves
  compute. Note that using this option successfully will require your scheduler subclass
  to implement `MySchedulerSubclass.run_trials` and
  `MySchedulerSubclass.poll_available_capacity`.
- `early_stopping_strategy` -- determines whether a trial should be stopped given the
  current state of the experiment, so that less promising trials can be terminated
  quickly. For more on this, see the Trial-Level Early Stopping tutorial:
  https://ax.dev/tutorials/early_stopping/early_stopping.html
- `global_stopping_strategy` -- determines whether the full optimization should be
  stopped or not, so that the run terminates when little progress is being made. A
  `global_stopping_strategy` instance can be passed to `SchedulerOptions` just as it is
  passed to `AxClient`, as illustrated in the tutorial on Global Stopping Strategy with
  AxClient: https://ax.dev/tutorials/gss.html

The rest of the options are described in the docstring below:

```python
print(SchedulerOptions.__doc__)
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `Settings for a scheduler instance.
    Attributes:
        max_pending_trials: Maximum number of pending trials the scheduler
            can have STAGED or RUNNING at once, required. If looking
            to use Runner.poll_available_capacity as a primary guide for
            how many trials should be pending at a given time, set this limit
            to a high number, as an upper bound on number of trials that
            should not be exceeded.
        trial_type: Type of trials (1-arm Trial or multi-arm Batch
            Trial) that will be deployed using the scheduler. Defaults
            to 1-arm Trial. NOTE: use BatchTrial only if need to
            evaluate multiple arms *together*, e.g. in an A/B-test
            influenced by data nonstationarity. For cases where just
            deploying multiple arms at once is beneficial but the trials
            are evaluated *independently*, implement run_trials method
            in scheduler subclass, to deploy multiple 1-arm trials at
            the same time.
        batch_size: If using BatchTrial the number of arms to be generated and
            deployed per trial.
        total_trials: Limit on number of trials a given Scheduler
            should run. If no stopping criteria are implemented on
            a given scheduler, exhaustion of this number of trials
            will be used as default stopping criterion in
            Scheduler.run_all_trials. Required to be non-null if
            using Scheduler.run_all_trials (not required for
            Scheduler.run_n_trials).
        tolerated_trial_failure_rate: Fraction of trials in this
            optimization that are allowed to fail without the whole
            optimization ending. Expects value between 0 and 1.
            NOTE: Failure rate checks begin once
            min_failed_trials_for_failure_rate_check trials have
            failed; after that point if the ratio of failed trials
            to total trials ran so far exceeds the failure rate,
            the optimization will halt.
        min_failed_trials_for_failure_rate_check: The minimum number
            of trials that must fail in Scheduler in order to start
            checking failure rate.
        log_filepath: File, to which to write optimization logs.
        logging_level: Minimum level of logging statements to log,
            defaults to logging.INFO.
        ttl_seconds_for_trials: Optional TTL for all trials created
            within this Scheduler, in seconds. Trials that remain
            RUNNING for more than their TTL seconds will be marked
            FAILED once the TTL elapses and may be re-suggested by
            the Ax optimization models.
        init_seconds_between_polls: Initial wait between rounds of
            polling, in seconds. Relevant if using the default wait-
            for-completed-runs functionality of the base Scheduler
            (if wait_for_completed_trials_and_report_results is not
            overridden). With the default waiting, every time a poll
            returns that no trial evaluations completed, wait
            time will increase; once some completed trial evaluations
            are found, it will reset back to this value. Specify 0
            to not introduce any wait between polls.
        min_seconds_before_poll: Minimum number of seconds between
            beginning to run a trial and the first poll to check
            trial status.
        timeout_hours: Number of hours after which the optimization will abort.
        seconds_between_polls_backoff_factor: The rate at which the poll
            interval increases.
        run_trials_in_batches: If True and poll_available_capacity is
            implemented to return non-null results, trials will be dispatched
            in groups via run_trials instead of one-by-one via run_trial.
            This allows to save time, IO calls or computation in cases where
            dispatching trials in groups is more efficient then sequential
            deployment. The size of the groups will be determined as
            the minimum of self.poll_available_capacity() and the number
            of generator runs that the generation strategy is able to produce
            without more data or reaching its allowed max paralellism limit.
        debug_log_run_metadata: Whether to log run_metadata for debugging purposes.
        early_stopping_strategy: A BaseEarlyStoppingStrategy that determines
            whether a trial should be stopped given the current state of
            the experiment. Used in should_stop_trials_early.
        global_stopping_strategy: A BaseGlobalStoppingStrategy that determines
            whether the full optimization should be stopped or not.
        suppress_storage_errors_after_retries: Whether to fully suppress SQL
            storage-related errors if encountered, after retrying the call
            multiple times. Only use if SQL storage is not important for the given
            use case, since this will only log, but not raise, an exception if
            it's encountered while saving to DB or loading from it.
        wait_for_running_trials: Whether the scheduler should wait for running trials
            or exit.
        fetch_kwargs: Kwargs to be used when fetching data.
        validate_metrics: Whether to raise an error if there is a problem with the
            metrics attached to the experiment.
        status_quo_weight: The weight of the status quo arm. This is only used
            if the scheduler is using a BatchTrial. This requires that the status_quo
            be set on the experiment.
        enforce_immutable_search_space_and_opt_config: Whether to enforce that the
            search space and optimization config are immutable.  If true, will add
            "immutable_search_space_and_opt_config": True to experiment properties
        mt_experiment_trial_type: Type of trial to run for MultiTypeExperiments. This
            is currently required for MultiTypeExperiments. This is ignored for
            "regular" or single type experiments. If you don't know what a single type
            experiment is, you don't need this.

## 8. Advanced functionality

### 8a. Reporting results to an external system

The `Scheduler` can report the optimization result to an external system each time there
are new completed trials if the user-implemented subclass implements
`MySchedulerSubclass.report_results` to do so. For example, the folliwing method:

```
class MySchedulerSubclass(Scheduler):
    ...
    
    def report_results(self, force_refit: bool = False):
        write_to_external_database(len(self.experiment.trials))
        return (True, \{})  # Returns optimization success status and optional dict of outputs.
```

could be used to record number of trials in experiment so far in an external database.

Since `report_results` is an instance method, it has access to `self.experiment` and
`self.generation_strategy`, which contain all the information about the state of the
optimization thus far.

### 8b. Using `run_trials_and_yield_results` generator method

In some systems it's beneficial to have greater control over `Scheduler.run_n_trials`
instead of just starting it and needing to wait for it to run all the way to completion
before having access to its output. For this purpose, the `Scheduler` implements a
generator method `run_trials_and_yield_results`, which yields the output of
`Scheduler.report_results` each time there are new completed trials and can be used like
so:

```python
class ResultReportingScheduler(Scheduler):
    def report_results(self, force_refit: bool = False):
        return True, {
            "trials so far": len(self.experiment.trials),
            "currently producing trials from generation step": self.generation_strategy._curr.model_name,
            "running trials": [t.index for t in self.running_trials],
        }
```

```python
experiment = make_branin_experiment_with_runner_and_metric()
scheduler = ResultReportingScheduler(
    experiment=experiment,
    generation_strategy=choose_generation_strategy(
        search_space=experiment.search_space,
        max_parallelism_cap=3,
    ),
    options=SchedulerOptions(),
)

for reported_result in scheduler.run_trials_and_yield_results(max_trials=6):
    print("Reported result: ", reported_result)
```
