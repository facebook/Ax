# Generation Strategy (GS) Tutorial

`GenerationStrategy`
([API reference](https://ax.dev/api/modelbridge.html#ax.modelbridge.generation_strategy.GenerationStrategy))
is a key abstraction in Ax:

- It allows for specifying multiple optimization algorithms to chain one after another
  in the course of the optimization.
- Many higher-level APIs in Ax use generation strategies: Service and Loop APIs,
  `Scheduler` etc. (tutorials for all those higher-level APIs are here:
  https://ax.dev/tutorials/).
- Generation strategy allows for storage and resumption of modeling setups, making
  optimization resumable from SQL or JSON snapshots.

This tutorial walks through a few examples of generation strategies and discusses its
important settings. Before reading it, we recommend familiarizing yourself with how
`Model` and `ModelBridge` work in Ax:
https://ax.dev/docs/models.html#deeper-dive-organization-of-the-modeling-stack.

## 1. Quick-start examples

### 1A. Manually configured generation strategy

Below is a typical generation strategy used for most single-objective optimization cases
in Ax:

```python
gs = GenerationStrategy(
    steps=[
        # 1. Initialization step (does not require pre-existing data and is well-suited for
        # initial sampling of the search space)
        GenerationStep(
            model=Models.SOBOL,
            num_trials=5,  # How many trials should be produced from this generation step
            min_trials_observed=3,  # How many trials need to be completed to move to next model
            max_parallelism=5,  # Max parallelism for this step
            model_kwargs={"seed": 999},  # Any kwargs you want passed into the model
            model_gen_kwargs={},  # Any kwargs you want passed to `modelbridge.gen`
        ),
        # 2. Bayesian optimization step (requires data obtained from previous phase and learns
        # from all data available at the time of each new candidate generation call)
        GenerationStep(
            model=Models.BOTORCH_MODULAR,
            num_trials=-1,  # No limitation on how many trials should be produced from this step
            max_parallelism=3,  # Parallelism limit for this step, often lower than for Sobol
            # More on parallelism vs. required samples in BayesOpt:
            # https://ax.dev/docs/bayesopt.html#tradeoff-between-parallelism-and-total-number-of-trials
        ),
    ]
)
```

### 1B. Auto-selected generation strategy

Ax provides a
[`choose_generation_strategy`](https://github.com/facebook/Ax/blob/main/ax/modelbridge/dispatch_utils.py#L115)
utility, which can auto-select a suitable generation strategy given a search space and
an array of other optional settings. The utility is fairly simple at the moment, but
additional development (support for multi-objective optimization, multi-fidelity
optimization, Bayesian optimization with categorical kernels etc.) is coming soon.

```python
gs = choose_generation_strategy(
    # Required arguments:
    search_space=get_branin_search_space(),  # Ax `SearchSpace`
    # Some optional arguments (shown with their defaults), see API docs for more settings:
    # https://ax.dev/api/modelbridge.html#module-ax.modelbridge.dispatch_utils
    use_batch_trials=False,  # Whether this GS will be used to generate 1-arm `Trial`-s or `BatchTrials`
    no_bayesian_optimization=False,  # Use quasi-random candidate generation without BayesOpt
    max_parallelism_override=None,  # Integer, to which to set the `max_parallelism` setting of all steps in this GS
)
gs
```

### 1C. Candidate generation from a generation strategy

While often used through Service or Loop API or other higher-order abstractions like the
Ax `Scheduler` (where the generation strategy is used to fit models and produce
candidates from them under-the-hood), it's also possible to use the GS directly, in
place of a `ModelBridge` instance. The interface of `GenerationStrategy.gen` is the same
as `ModelBridge.gen`.

```python
experiment = get_branin_experiment()
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:13] ax.core.experiment: The is_test flag has been set to True. This flag is meant purely for development and integration testing purposes. If you are running a live experiment, please set this flag to False`
}
</CellOutput>

Note that it's important to **specify pending observations** to the call to `gen` to
avoid getting the same points re-suggested. Without `pending_observations` argument, Ax
models are not aware of points that should be excluded from generation. Points are
considered "pending" when they belong to `STAGED`, `RUNNING`, or `ABANDONED` trials
(with the latter included so model does not re-suggest points that are considered "bad"
and should not be re-suggested).

If the call to `get_pending_obervation_features` becomes slow in your setup (since it
performs data-fetching etc.), you can opt for
`get_pending_observation_features_based_on_trial_status` (also from
`ax.modelbridge.modelbridge_utils`), but note the limitations of that utility (detailed
in its docstring).

```python
generator_run = gs.gen(
    experiment=experiment,  # Ax `Experiment`, for which to generate new candidates
    data=None,  # Ax `Data` to use for model training, optional.
    n=1,  # Number of candidate arms to produce
    pending_observations=get_pending_observation_features(
        experiment
    ),  # Points that should not be re-generated
    # Any other kwargs specified will be passed through to `ModelBridge.gen` along with `GenerationStep.model_gen_kwargs`
)
generator_run
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `/Users/cristianlara/Projects/Ax-1.0/ax/modelbridge/cross_validation.py:463: UserWarning: Encountered exception in computing model fit quality: RandomModelBridge does not support prediction.
  warn("Encountered exception in computing model fit quality: " + str(e))`
}
</CellOutput>


<CellOutput>
{
  `GeneratorRun(1 arms, total weight 1.0)`
}
</CellOutput>

Then we can add the newly produced
[`GeneratorRun`](https://ax.dev/docs/glossary.html#generator-run) to the experiment as a
[`Trial` (or `BatchTrial` if `n` > 1)](https://ax.dev/docs/glossary.html#trial):

```python
trial = experiment.new_trial(generator_run)
trial
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `Trial(experiment_name='branin_test_experiment', index=0, status=TrialStatus.CANDIDATE, arm=Arm(name='0_0', parameters={'x1': 0.4080374538898468, 'x2': 2.102140188217163}))`
}
</CellOutput>

**Important notes on `GenerationStrategy.gen`:**

- if `data` argument above is not specified, GS will pull experiment data from cache via
  `experiment.lookup_data`,
- without specifying `pending_observations`, the GS (and any model in Ax) could produce
  the same candidate over and over, as without that argument the model is not 'aware'
  that the candidate is part of a `RUNNING` or `ABANDONED` trial and should not be
  re-suggested again.

In cases where `get_pending_observation_features` is too slow and the experiment
consists of 1-arm `Trial`-s only, it's possible to use
`get_pending_observation_features_based_on_trial_status` instead (found in the same
file).

Note that when using the Ax Service API, one of the arguments to `AxClient` is
`choose_generation_strategy_kwargs`; specifying that argument is a convenient way to
influence the choice of generation strategy in `AxClient` without manually specifying a
full `GenerationStrategy`.

______________________________________________________________________

## 2. `GenerationStep` as a building block of generation strategy

### 2A. Describing a model to use in a given `GenerationStep`

There are two ways of specifying a model for a generation step: via an entry in a
`Models` enum or via a 'factory function' –– a callable model constructor (e.g.
[`get_GPEI`](https://github.com/facebook/Ax/blob/0e454b71d5e07b183c0866855555b6a21ddd5da1/ax/modelbridge/factory.py#L154)
and other factory functions in the same file). Note that using the latter path, a
factory function, will prohibit `GenerationStrategy` storage and is generally
discouraged.

### 2B. Other `GenerationStep` settings

All of the available settings are described in the documentation:

```python
print(GenerationStep.__doc__)
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `One step in the generation strategy, corresponds to a single model.
    Describes the model, how many trials will be generated with this model, what
    minimum number of observations is required to proceed to the next model, etc.
    NOTE: Model can be specified either from the model registry
    (ax.modelbridge.registry.Models or using a callable model constructor. Only
    models from the registry can be saved, and thus optimization can only be
    resumed if interrupted when using models from the registry.
    Args:
        model: A member of Models enum or a callable returning an instance of
            ModelBridge with an instantiated underlying Model. Refer to
            ax/modelbridge/factory.py for examples of such callables.
        num_trials: How many trials to generate with the model from this step.
            If set to -1, trials will continue to be generated from this model
            as long as generation_strategy.gen is called (available only for
            the last of the generation steps).
        min_trials_observed: How many trials must be completed before the
            generation strategy can proceed to the next step. Defaults to 0.
            If num_trials of a given step have been generated but min_trials_
            observed have not been completed, a call to generation_strategy.gen
            will fail with a DataRequiredError.
        max_parallelism: How many trials generated in the course of this step are
            allowed to be run (i.e. have trial.status of RUNNING) simultaneously.
            If max_parallelism trials from this step are already running, a call
            to generation_strategy.gen will fail with a MaxParallelismReached
            Exception, indicating that more trials need to be completed before
            generating and running next trials.
        use_update: DEPRECATED.
        enforce_num_trials: Whether to enforce that only num_trials are generated
            from the given step. If False and num_trials have been generated, but
            min_trials_observed have not been completed, generation_strategy.gen
            will continue generating trials from the current step, exceeding num_
            trials for it. Allows to avoid DataRequiredError, but delays
            proceeding to next generation step.
        model_kwargs: Dictionary of kwargs to pass into the model constructor on
            instantiation. E.g. if model is Models.SOBOL, kwargs will be applied
            as Models.SOBOL(**model_kwargs); if model is get_sobol, get_sobol(
            **model_kwargs). NOTE: if generation strategy is interrupted and
            resumed from a stored snapshot and its last used model has state saved on
            its generator runs, model_kwargs is updated with the state dict of the
            model, retrieved from the last generator run of this generation strategy.
        model_gen_kwargs: Each call to generation_strategy.gen performs a call to the
            step's model's gen under the hood; model_gen_kwargs will be passed to
            the model's gen like so: model.gen(**model_gen_kwargs).
        completion_criteria: List of TransitionCriterion. All is_met must evaluate
            True for the GenerationStrategy to move on to the next Step
        index: Index of this generation step, for use internally in Generation
            Strategy. Do not assign as it will be reassigned when instantiating
            GenerationStrategy with a list of its steps.
        should_deduplicate: Whether to deduplicate the parameters of proposed arms
            against those of previous arms via rejection sampling. If this is True,
            the generation strategy will discard generator runs produced from the
            generation step that has should_deduplicate=True if they contain arms
            already present on the experiment and replace them with new generator runs.
            If no generator run with entirely unique arms could be produced in 5
            attempts, a GenerationStrategyRepeatedPoints error will be raised, as we
            assume that the optimization converged when the model can no longer suggest
            unique arms.
        model_name: Optional name of the model. If not specified, defaults to the
            model key of the model spec.
    Note for developers: by "model" here we really mean an Ax ModelBridge object, which
    contains an Ax Model under the hood. We call it "model" here to simplify and focus
    on explaining the logic of GenerationStep and GenerationStrategy.
    `
}
</CellOutput>

## 2C. Chaining `GenerationStep`-s together

A `GenerationStrategy` moves from one step to another when:

1. `N=num_trials` generator runs were produced and attached as trials to the experiment
   AND
1. `M=min_trials_observed` have been completed and have data.

**Caveat: `enforce_num_trials` setting**:

1. If `enforce_num_trials=True` for a given generation step, if 1) is reached but 2) is
   not yet reached, the generation strategy will raise a `DataRequiredError`, indicating
   that more trials need to be completed before the next step.
1. If `enforce_num_trials=False`, the GS will continue producing generator runs from the
   current step until 2) is reached.

## 2D. `max_parallelism` enforcement

Generation strategy can restrict the number of trials that can be ran simultaneously (to
encourage sequential optimization, which benefits Bayesian optimization performance).
When the parallelism limit is reached, a call to `GenerationStrategy.gen` will result in
a `MaxParallelismReachedException`.

The correct way to handle this exception:

1. Make sure that `GenerationStep.max_parallelism` is configured correctly for all steps
   in your generation strategy (to disable it completely, configure
   `GenerationStep.max_parallelism=None`),
1. When encountering the exception, wait to produce more generator runs until more trial
   evluations complete and log the trial completion via `trial.mark_completed`.

______________________________________________________________________

## 3. SQL and JSON storage of a generation strategy

When used through Service API or `Scheduler`, generation strategy will be automatically
stored to SQL or JSON via specifying `DBSettings` to either `AxClient` or `Scheduler`
(details in respective tutorials in the ["Tutorials" page](https://ax.dev/tutorials/)).
Generation strategy can also be stored to SQL or JSON individually, as shown below.

More detail on SQL and JSON storage in Ax generally can be
[found in "Building Blocks of Ax" tutorial](https://ax.dev/tutorials/building_blocks.html#9.-Save-to-JSON-or-SQL).

### 3A. SQL storage

For SQL storage setup in Ax, read through the
["Storage" documentation page](https://ax.dev/docs/storage.html).

Note that unlike an Ax experiment, a generation strategy does not have a name or another
unique identifier. Therefore, a generation strategy is stored in association with
experiment and can be retrieved by the associated experiment's name.

```python
from ax.storage.sqa_store.db import (
    create_all_tables,
    get_engine,
    init_engine_and_session_factory,
)
from ax.storage.sqa_store.load import (
    load_experiment,
    load_generation_strategy_by_experiment_name,
)
from ax.storage.sqa_store.save import save_experiment, save_generation_strategy

init_engine_and_session_factory(url="sqlite:///foo2.db")

engine = get_engine()
create_all_tables(engine)

save_experiment(experiment)
save_generation_strategy(gs)

experiment = load_experiment(experiment_name=experiment.name)
gs = load_generation_strategy_by_experiment_name(
    experiment_name=experiment.name,
    experiment=experiment,  # Can optionally specify experiment object to avoid loading it from database twice
)
gs
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:14] ax.core.experiment: The is_test flag has been set to True. This flag is meant purely for development and integration testing purposes. If you are running a live experiment, please set this flag to False`
}
</CellOutput>


<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:14] ax.core.experiment: The is_test flag has been set to True. This flag is meant purely for development and integration testing purposes. If you are running a live experiment, please set this flag to False`
}
</CellOutput>


<CellOutput>
{
  `GenerationStrategy(name='Sobol+BoTorch', steps=[Sobol for 5 trials, BoTorch for subsequent trials])`
}
</CellOutput>

### 3B. JSON storage

```python
from ax.storage.json_store.decoder import object_from_json
from ax.storage.json_store.encoder import object_to_json

gs_json = object_to_json(gs)  # Can be written to a file or string via `json.dump` etc.
gs = object_from_json(
    gs_json
)  # Decoded back from JSON (can be loaded from file, string via `json.load` etc.)
gs
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `[INFO 09-29 17:02:14] ax.core.experiment: The is_test flag has been set to True. This flag is meant purely for development and integration testing purposes. If you are running a live experiment, please set this flag to False`
}
</CellOutput>


<CellOutput>
{
  `GenerationStrategy(name='Sobol+BoTorch', steps=[Sobol for 5 trials, BoTorch for subsequent trials])`
}
</CellOutput>

______________________________________________________________________

## 3. Advanced considerations

Below is a list of important "gotchas" of using generation strategy (especially outside
of the higher-level APIs like the Service API or the `Scheduler`):

### 3A. `GenerationStrategy.gen` produces `GeneratorRun`-s, not trials

Since `GenerationStrategy.gen` mimics `ModelBridge.gen` and allows for human-in-the-loop
usage mode, a call to `gen` produces a `GeneratorRun`, which can then be added (or
altered before addition or not added at all) to a `Trial` or `BatchTrial` on a given
experiment. So it's important to add the generator run to a trial, since otherwise it
will not be attached to the experiment on its own.

```python
generator_run = gs.gen(
    experiment=experiment,
    n=1,
    pending_observations=get_pending_observation_features(experiment),
)
experiment.new_trial(generator_run)
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `/Users/cristianlara/Projects/Ax-1.0/ax/modelbridge/cross_validation.py:463: UserWarning: Encountered exception in computing model fit quality: RandomModelBridge does not support prediction.
  warn("Encountered exception in computing model fit quality: " + str(e))`
}
</CellOutput>


<CellOutput>
{
  `Trial(experiment_name='branin_test_experiment', index=1, status=TrialStatus.CANDIDATE, arm=Arm(name='1_0', parameters={'x1': 8.644633921794593, 'x2': 13.181734532117844}))`
}
</CellOutput>

### 3B. `model_kwargs` elements that do not define serialization logic in Ax

Note that passing objects that are not yet serializable in Ax (e.g. a BoTorch `Prior`
object) as part of `GenerationStep.model_kwargs` or `GenerationStep.model_gen_kwargs`
will prevent correct generation strategy storage. If this becomes a problem, feel free
to open an issue on our Github: https://github.com/facebook/Ax/issues to get help with
adding storage support for a given object.

### 3C. Why prefer `Models` enum entries over a factory function?

1. **Storage potential:** a call to, for example, `Models.GPEI` captures all arguments
   to the model and model bridge and stores them on a generator runs, subsequently
   produced by the model. Since the capturing logic is part of `Models.__call__`
   function, it is not present in a factory function. Furthermore, there is no safe and
   flexible way to serialize callables in Python.
1. **Standardization:** While a 'factory function' is by default more flexible (accepts
   any specified inputs and produces a `ModelBridge` with an underlying `Model` instance
   based on them), it is not standard in terms of its inputs. `Models` introduces a
   standardized interface, making it easy to adapt any example to one's specific case.

### 3D. How can I request more modeling setups added to `Models` and natively supported in Ax?

Please open a [Github issue](https://github.com/facebook/Ax/issues) to request a new
modeling setup in Ax (or for any other questions or requests).
