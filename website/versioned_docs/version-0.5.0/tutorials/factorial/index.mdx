# Factorial design with empirical Bayes and Thompson Sampling

This tutorial illustrates how to run a factorial experiment. In such an experiment, each
parameter (factor) can be assigned one of multiple discrete values (levels). A
full-factorial experiment design explores all possible combinations of factors and
levels.

For instance, consider a banner with a title and an image. We are considering two
different titles and three different images. A full-factorial experiment will compare
all 2\*3=6 possible combinations of title and image, to see which version of the banner
performs the best.

In this example, we first run an exploratory batch to collect data on all possible
combinations. Then we use empirical Bayes to model the data and shrink noisy estimates
toward the mean. Next, we use Thompson Sampling to suggest a set of arms (combinations
of factors and levels) on which to collect more data. We repeat the process until we
have identified the best performing combination(s).

import sys
in_colab = 'google.colab' in sys.modules

## 1. Define the search space

First, we define our search space. A factorial search space contains a ChoiceParameter
for each factor, where the values of the parameter are its levels.

```python
search_space = SearchSpace(
    parameters=[
        ChoiceParameter(
            name="factor1",
            parameter_type=ParameterType.STRING,
            values=["level11", "level12", "level13"],
        ),
        ChoiceParameter(
            name="factor2",
            parameter_type=ParameterType.STRING,
            values=["level21", "level22"],
        ),
        ChoiceParameter(
            name="factor3",
            parameter_type=ParameterType.STRING,
            values=["level31", "level32", "level33", "level34"],
        ),
    ]
)
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `/tmp/ipykernel_9125/3645676115.py:3: AxParameterWarning:

## 2. Define a custom metric

Second, we define a custom metric, which is responsible for computing the mean and
standard error of a given arm.

In this example, each possible parameter value is given a coefficient. The higher the
level, the higher the coefficient, and the higher the coefficients, the greater the
mean.

The standard error of each arm is determined by the weight passed into the evaluation
function, which represents the size of the population on which this arm was evaluated.
The higher the weight, the greater the sample size, and thus the lower the standard
error.

```python
from ax import Data, Metric
from ax.utils.common.result import Ok
import pandas as pd
from random import random


one_hot_encoder = skl.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder(
    categories=[par.values for par in search_space.parameters.values()],
)


class FactorialMetric(Metric):
    def fetch_trial_data(self, trial):
        records = []
        for arm_name, arm in trial.arms_by_name.items():
            params = arm.parameters
            batch_size = 10000
            noise_level = 0.0
            weight = trial.normalized_arm_weights().get(arm, 1.0)
            coefficients = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
            features = np.array(list(params.values())).reshape(1, -1)
            encoded_features = one_hot_encoder.fit_transform(features)
            z = (
                coefficients @ encoded_features.T
                + np.sqrt(noise_level) * np.random.randn()
            )
            p = np.exp(z) / (1 + np.exp(z))
            plays = np.random.binomial(batch_size, weight)
            successes = np.random.binomial(plays, p)
            records.append(
                {
                    "arm_name": arm_name,
                    "metric_name": self.name,
                    "trial_index": trial.index,
                    "mean": float(successes) / plays,
                    "sem": agresti_coull_sem(successes, plays),
                }
            )
        return Ok(value=Data(df=pd.DataFrame.from_records(records)))
```

## 3. Define the experiment

We now set up our experiment and define the status quo arm, in which each parameter is
assigned to the lowest level.

```python
from ax import Runner


class MyRunner(Runner):
    def run(self, trial):
        trial_metadata = {"name": str(trial.index)}
        return trial_metadata


exp = Experiment(
    name="my_factorial_closed_loop_experiment",
    search_space=search_space,
    optimization_config=OptimizationConfig(
        objective=Objective(metric=FactorialMetric(name="success_metric"), minimize=False)
    ),
    runner=MyRunner(),
)
exp.status_quo = Arm(
    parameters={"factor1": "level11", "factor2": "level21", "factor3": "level31"}
)
```

## 4. Run an exploratory batch

We then generate an a set of arms that covers the full space of the factorial design,
including the status quo. There are three parameters, with two, three, and four values,
respectively, so there are 24 possible arms.

```python
factorial = Models.FACTORIAL(search_space=exp.search_space)
factorial_run = factorial.gen(
    n=-1
)  # Number of arms to generate is derived from the search space.
print(len(factorial_run.arms))
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `24`
}
</CellOutput>

Now we create a trial including all of these arms, so that we can collect data and
evaluate the performance of each.

```python
trial = exp.new_batch_trial(optimize_for_power=True).add_generator_run(
    factorial_run, multiplier=1
)
```

By default, the weight of each arm in `factorial_run` will be 1. However, to optimize
for power on the contrasts of `k` groups against the status quo, the status quo should
be `sqrt(k)` larger than any of the treatment groups. Since we have 24 different arms in
our search space, the status quo should be roughly five times larger. That larger weight
is automatically set by Ax under the hood if `optimize_for_power` kwarg is set to True
on new batched trial creation.

```python
trial._status_quo_weight_override
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `4.795831523312719`
}
</CellOutput>

## 5. Iterate using Thompson Sampling

Next, we run multiple trials (iterations of the experiment) to hone in on the optimal
arm(s).

In each iteration, we first collect data about all arms in that trial by calling
`trial.run()` and `trial.mark_complete()`. Then we run Thompson Sampling, which assigns
a weight to each arm that is proportional to the probability of that arm being the best.
Arms whose weight exceed `min_weight` are added to the next trial, so that we can gather
more data on their performance.

```python
models = []
for i in range(4):
    print(f"Running trial {i+1}...")
    trial.run()
    trial.mark_completed()
    thompson = Models.THOMPSON(experiment=exp, data=trial.fetch_data(), min_weight=0.01)
    models.append(thompson)
    thompson_run = thompson.gen(n=-1)
    trial = exp.new_batch_trial(optimize_for_power=True).add_generator_run(thompson_run)
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `Running trial 1...
Running trial 2...
Running trial 3...
Running trial 4...`
}

## Plot 1: Predicted outcomes for each arm in initial trial

The plot below shows the mean and standard error for each arm in the first trial. We can
see that the standard error for the status quo is the smallest, since this arm was
assigned 5x weight.

```python
render(plot_fitted(models[0], metric="success_metric", rel=False))
```

<PlotlyFigure data={require('./assets/plot_data/5869bd2c-4aee-45c7-a5c6-c3c85c3fb2e2.json')} />

## Plot 2: Predicted outcomes for arms in last trial

The following plot below shows the mean and standard error for each arm that made it to
the last trial (as well as the status quo, which appears throughout).

```python
render(plot_fitted(models[-1], metric="success_metric", rel=False))
```

<PlotlyFigure data={require('./assets/plot_data/f52dec8c-770a-4edb-80fe-fc985c98add3.json')} />

As expected given our evaluation function, arms with higher levels perform better and
are given higher weight. Below we see the arms that made it to the final trial.

```python
results = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        {"values": ",".join(arm.parameters.values()), "weight": weight}
        for arm, weight in trial.normalized_arm_weights().items()
    ]
)
print(results)
```

<CellOutput>
{
  `                    values    weight
0  level13,level22,level34  0.416585
1  level12,level22,level33  0.205725
2  level13,level22,level33  0.011665
3  level11,level21,level31  0.366025`
}
</CellOutput>

## Plot 3: Rollout Process

We can also visualize the progression of the experience in the following rollout chart.
Each bar represents a trial, and the width of the bands within a bar are proportional to
the weight of the arms in that trial.

In the first trial, all arms appear with equal weight, except for the status quo. By the
last trial, we have narrowed our focus to only four arms, with arm 0_22 (the arm with
the highest levels) having the greatest weight.

```python
from ax.plot.bandit_rollout import plot_bandit_rollout
from ax.utils.notebook.plotting import render

render(plot_bandit_rollout(exp))
```

<PlotlyFigure data={require('./assets/plot_data/570b0b53-75bc-4906-8064-7b040ca93c44.json')} />

## Plot 4: Marginal Effects

Finally, we can examine which parameter values had the greatest effect on the overall
arm value. As we see in the diagram below, arms whose parameters were assigned the lower
level values (such as `levell1`, `levell2`, `level31` and `level32`) performed worse
than average, whereas arms with higher levels performed better than average.

```python
from ax.plot.marginal_effects import plot_marginal_effects

render(plot_marginal_effects(models[0], "success_metric"))
```
