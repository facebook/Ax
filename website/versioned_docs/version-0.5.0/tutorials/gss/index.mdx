This tutorial illustrates use of a Global Stopping Strategy (GSS) in combination with
the Service API. For background on the Service API, see the Service API Tutorial:
https://ax.dev/tutorials/gpei_hartmann_service.html GSS is also supported in the
Scheduler API, where it can be provided as part of `SchedulerOptions`. For more on
`Scheduler`, see the Scheduler tutorial: https://ax.dev/tutorials/scheduler.html

Global Stopping stops an optimization loop when some data-based criteria are met which
suggest that future trials will not be very helpful. For example, we might stop when
there has been very little improvement in the last five trials. This is as opposed to
trial-level early stopping, which monitors the results of expensive evaluations and
terminates those that are unlikely to produce promising results, freeing resources to
explore more promising configurations. For more on trial-level early stopping, see the
tutorial: https://ax.dev/tutorials/early_stopping/early_stopping.html

# 1. What happens without global stopping? Optimization can run for too long.

This example uses the Branin test problem. We run 25 trials, which turns out to be far
more than needed, because we get close to the optimum quite quickly.

```python
def evaluate(parameters):
    x = np.array([parameters.get(f"x{i+1}") for i in range(2)])
    return {"branin": (branin(x), 0.0)}
```

```python
params = [
    {
        "name": f"x{i + 1}",
        "type": "range",
        "bounds": [*Branin._domain[i]],
        "value_type": "float",
        "log_scale": False,
    }

    for i in range(2)
]
```

```python
ax_client = AxClient(random_seed=0, verbose_logging=False)

ax_client.create_experiment(
    name="branin_test_experiment",
    parameters=params,
    objectives={"branin": ObjectiveProperties(minimize=True)},
    is_test=True,
)

# 2. Optimization with global stopping, with the Service API

Rather than running a fixed number of trials, we can use a GlobalStoppingStrategy (GSS),
which checks whether some stopping criteria have been met when `get_next_trial` is
called. Here, we use an `ImprovementGlobalStoppingStrategy`, which checks whether the
the last `window_size` trials have improved by more than some threshold amount.

For single-objective optimization, which we are doing here,
`ImprovementGlobalStoppingStrategy` checks if an improvement is "significant" by
comparing it to the inter-quartile range (IQR) of the objective values attained so far.

`ImprovementGlobalStoppingStrategy` also supports multi-objective optimization (MOO), in
which case it checks whether the percentage improvement in hypervolume over the last
`window_size` trials exceeds `improvement_bar`.

```python
from ax.global_stopping.strategies.improvement import ImprovementGlobalStoppingStrategy
from ax.exceptions.core import OptimizationShouldStop
```

```python
# Start considering stopping only after the 5 initialization trials + 5 GPEI trials.
# Stop if the improvement in the best point in the past 5 trials is less than
# 1% of the IQR thus far.
stopping_strategy = ImprovementGlobalStoppingStrategy(
    min_trials=5 + 5, window_size=5, improvement_bar=0.01
)
```

```python
ax_client_gss = AxClient(
    global_stopping_strategy=stopping_strategy, random_seed=0, verbose_logging=False
)

ax_client_gss.create_experiment(
    name="branin_test_experiment",
    parameters=params,
    objectives={"branin": ObjectiveProperties(minimize=True)},
    is_test=True,
)

If there has not been much improvement, `ImprovementGlobalStoppingStrategy` will raise
an exception. If the exception is raised, we catch it and terminate optimization.

```python
for i in range(25):
    try:
        parameters, trial_index = ax_client_gss.get_next_trial()
    except OptimizationShouldStop as exc:
        print(exc.message)
        break
    ax_client_gss.complete_trial(trial_index=trial_index, raw_data=evaluate(parameters))
```

# 3. Write your own custom Global Stopping Strategy

You can write a custom Global Stopping Strategy by subclassing
`BaseGlobalStoppingStrategy` and use it where `ImprovementGlobalStoppingStrategy` was
used above.

```python
from ax.global_stopping.strategies.base import BaseGlobalStoppingStrategy
from typing import Tuple
from ax.core.experiment import Experiment
from ax.core.base_trial import TrialStatus
from ax.global_stopping.strategies.improvement import constraint_satisfaction
```

Here, we define `SimpleThresholdGlobalStoppingStrategy`, which stops when we observe a
point better than a provided threshold. This can be useful when there is a known
optimum. For example, the Branin function has an optimum of zero. When the optimum is
not known, this can still be useful from a satisficing perspective: For example, maybe
we need a model to take up less than a certain amount of RAM so it doesn't crash our
usual hardware, but there is no benefit to further improvements.

```python
class SimpleThresholdGlobalStoppingStrategy(BaseGlobalStoppingStrategy):
    """
    A GSS that stops when we observe a point better than `threshold`.
    """
    def __init__(
        self,
        min_trials: int,
        inactive_when_pending_trials: bool = True,
        threshold: float = 0.1
    ):
        self.threshold = threshold
        super().__init__(
            min_trials=min_trials,
            inactive_when_pending_trials=inactive_when_pending_trials
        )
    
    def _should_stop_optimization(
        self, experiment: Experiment
    ) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        """
        Check if the best seen is better than `self.threshold`.
        """
        feasible_objectives = [
            trial.objective_mean
            for trial in experiment.trials_by_status[TrialStatus.COMPLETED]
            if constraint_satisfaction(trial)
        ]

        # Computing the interquartile for scaling the difference
        if len(feasible_objectives) <= 1:
            message = "There are not enough feasible arms tried yet."
            return False, message
        
        minimize = experiment.optimization_config.objective.minimize
        if minimize:
            best = np.min(feasible_objectives)
            stop = best < self.threshold
        else:
            best = np.max(feasible_objectives)
            stop = best > self.threshold

        comparison = "less" if minimize else "greater"
        if stop:
            message = (
                f"The best objective seen is {best:.3f}, which is {comparison} "
                f"than the threshold of {self.threshold:.3f}."
            )
        else:
            message = ""

        return stop, message
