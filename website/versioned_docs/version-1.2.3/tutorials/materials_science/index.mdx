# Ax for Materials Science

Some optimization experiments, like the one described in this
[tutorial](../getting_started), can be conducted in a completely automated manner. Other
experiments may require a human in the loop, for instance a scientist manually
conducting and evaluating each trial in a lab. In this tutorial we demonstrate this
ask-tell optimization in a human-in-the-loop setting by imagining the task of maximizing
the strength of a 3D printed part using compression testing (i.e., crushing the part)
where different print settings will have to be manually tried and evaluated.

### Background

In 3D printing, several parameters can significantly affect the mechanical properties of
the printed object:

- **Infill Density**: The percentage of material used inside the object. Higher infill
  density generally increases strength but also weight and material usage.

- **Layer Height**: The thickness of each layer of material. Smaller layer heights can
  improve surface finish and detail but increase print time.

- **Infill Type**: The pattern used to fill the interior of the object. Different
  patterns (e.g., honeycomb, gyroid, lines, rectilinear) offer various balances of
  strength, speed, and material efficiency.

- **Strength Measurement**: In this tutorial, we assume the strength of the 3D printed
  part is measured using compression testing, which evaluates how the object performs
  under compressive stress.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand black box optimization concepts
- Define an optimization problem using Ax
- Configure and run an experiment using Ax's `Client`
- Analyze the results of the optimization

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Python and basic programming concepts
- Understanding of [adaptive experimentation](../../intro-to-ae.mdx) and
  [Bayesian optimization](../../intro-to-bo.mdx)

## Step 1: Import Necessary Modules

```python
from ax.api.client import Client
from ax.api.configs import  RangeParameterConfig, ChoiceParameterConfig
```

## Step 2: Initialize Client

Create an instance of the `Client` to manage the state of your experiment.

```python
client = Client()
```

## Step 3: Configure Experiment

Define the parameters for the 3D printing optimization problem. The infill density and
layer height can take on any value within their respective bounds so we will configure
both using `RangeParameterConfig`s. On the other hand, infill type be either have one of
four distinct values: "honeycomb", "gyroid", "lines", or "rectilinear". We will use a
`ChoiceParameterConfig` to represent it in the optimization.

```python
infill_density = RangeParameterConfig(name="infill_density", parameter_type="float", bounds=(0, 100))
layer_height = RangeParameterConfig(name="layer_height", parameter_type="float", bounds=(0.1, 0.4))
infill_type = ChoiceParameterConfig(name="infill_type", parameter_type="str", values=["honeycomb", "gyroid", "lines", "rectilinear"])

client.configure_experiment(
    parameters=[infill_density, layer_height, infill_type],
    # The following arguments are only necessary when saving to the DB
    name="3d_print_strength_experiment",
    description="Maximize strength of 3D printed parts",
    owner="developer",
)
```

<CellOutput>
{
`/home/runner/work/Ax/Ax/ax/api/utils/instantiation/from_config.py:87: AxParameterWarning:
is_ordered is not specified for ChoiceParameter "infill_type". Defaulting to False  since the parameter is a string with more than 2 choices.. To override this behavior (or avoid this warning), specify is_ordered during ChoiceParameter construction. Note that choice parameters with exactly 2 choices are always considered ordered and that the user-supplied is_ordered has no effect in this particular case.`
}
</CellOutput>

## Step 4: Configure Optimization

We want to maximize the compressive strength of our part, so we will set the objective
to `compressive_strength`. However, we know that modifying the infill density, layer
height, and infill type will affect the weight of the part as well. We'll include a
requirement that the part must not weigh more than 10 grams by setting an outcome
constraint when we call `configure_experiment`.

The following code will tell the `Client` that we intend to maximize compressive
strength while keeping the weight less than 10 grams.

```python
client.configure_optimization(objective="compressive_strength", outcome_constraints=["weight <= 10"])
```

## Step 5: Run Trials

Now the `Client` has been configured we can begin conducting the experiment. Use
`attach_trial` to attach any existing data, use `get_next_trials` to generate parameter
suggestions, and use `complete_trial` to report manually observed results.

### Attach Preexisting Trials

Sometimes in our optimization experiments we may already have some previously collected
data from manual "trials" conducted before the Ax experiment began. This can be
incredibly useful! If we attach this data as custom trials, Ax will be able to use the
data points in its optimization algorithm and improve performance.

```python
# Pairs of previously evaluated parameterizations and associated metric readings
preexisting_trials = [
    (
        {"infill_density": 10.43, "layer_height": 0.3, "infill_type": "gyroid"},
        {"compressive_strength": 1.74, "weight": 0.52},
    ),
    (
        {"infill_density": 55.54, "layer_height": 0.12, "infill_type": "lines"},
        {"compressive_strength": 4.63, "weight": 2.31},
    ),
    (
        {"infill_density": 99.43, "layer_height": 0.35, "infill_type": "rectilinear"},
        {"compressive_strength": 5.68, "weight": 2.84},
    ),
    (
        {"infill_density": 41.44, "layer_height": 0.21, "infill_type": "rectilinear"},
        {"compressive_strength": 3.95, "weight": 1.97},
    ),
    (
        {"infill_density": 27.23, "layer_height": 0.37, "infill_type": "honeycomb"},
        {"compressive_strength": 7.36, "weight": 3.31},
    ),
    (
        {"infill_density": 33.57, "layer_height": 0.24, "infill_type": "honeycomb"},
        {"compressive_strength": 13.99, "weight": 6.29},
    ),
]

for parameters, data in preexisting_trials:
    # Attach the parameterization to the Client as a trial and immediately complete it with the preexisting data
    trial_index = client.attach_trial(parameters=parameters)
    client.complete_trial(trial_index=trial_index, raw_data=data)
```

}
</CellOutput>

### Ask for trials

Now, let's have Ax suggest which trials to evaluate so that we can find the optimal
configuration more efficiently. We'll do this by calling `get_next_trials`. We'll make
use of Ax's support for parallelism, i.e. suggesting more than one trial at a time --
this can allow us to conduct our experiment much faster! If our lab had three identical
3D printers, we could ask Ax for a batch of three trials and evaluate three different
infill density, layer height, and infill types at once.

Note that there will always be a tradeoff between "parallelism" and optimization
performance since the quality of a suggested trial is often proportional to the amount
of data Ax has access to.

```python
trials = client.get_next_trials(max_trials=3)
trials
```

<CellOutput>
{
`[INFO 02-19 18:59:54] ax.api.client: GenerationStrategy(name='Center+Sobol+MBM:fast', nodes=[CenterGenerationNode(next_node_name='Sobol'), GenerationNode(name='Sobol', generator_specs=[GeneratorSpec(generator_enum=Sobol, generator_key_override=None)], transition_criteria=[MinTrials(transition_to='MBM'), MinTrials(transition_to='MBM')], suggested_experiment_status=ExperimentStatus.INITIALIZATION), GenerationNode(name='MBM', generator_specs=[GeneratorSpec(generator_enum=BoTorch, generator_key_override=None)], transition_criteria=[], suggested_experiment_status=ExperimentStatus.OPTIMIZATION)]) chosen based on user input and problem structure.

}
</CellOutput>

### Tell Ax the results

In a real-world scenerio we would print parts using the three suggested
parameterizations and measure the compressive strength and weight manually, though in
this tutorial we will simulate by calling a function. Once the data is collected we will
tell Ax the result by calling `complete_trial`.

```python
def evaluate(
    infill_density: float, layer_height: float, infill_type: str
) -> dict[str, float]:
    strength_map = {"lines": 1, "rectilinear": 2, "gyroid": 5, "honeycomb": 10}
    weight_map = {"lines": 1, "rectilinear": 2, "gyroid": 3, "honeycomb": 9}

    return {
        "compressive_strength": (
            infill_density / layer_height * strength_map[infill_type]
        )
        / 100,
        "weight": (infill_density / layer_height * weight_map[infill_type]) / 200,
    }


for trial_index, parameters in trials.items():
    client.complete_trial(trial_index=trial_index, raw_data=evaluate(**parameters))
```

<CellOutput>
{
`[INFO 02-19 18:59:54] ax.api.client: Trial 6 marked COMPLETED.
[INFO 02-19 18:59:54] ax.api.client: Trial 7 marked COMPLETED.
[INFO 02-19 18:59:55] ax.api.client: Trial 8 marked COMPLETED.`
}
</CellOutput>

We'll repeat this process a number of times. Typically experimentation will continue
until a satisfactory combination has been found, experimentation resources (in this
example our 3D printing filliment) have been exhausted, or we feel we have spent enough
time on optimization.

```python
# Ask Ax for the next trials
trials = client.get_next_trials(max_trials=3)
trials

}
</CellOutput>

## Step 6: Analyze Results

At any time during the experiment you may analyze the results of the experiment. Most
commonly this means extracting the parameterization from the best performing trial you
conducted. The best trial will have the optimal objective value **without violating any
outcome constraints**.

```python
best_parameters, prediction, index, name = client.get_best_parameterization()
print("Best Parameters:", best_parameters)
print("Prediction (mean, variance):", prediction)
```

<CellOutput>
{
`Best Parameters: {'infill_density': 33.57, 'layer_height': 0.24, 'infill_type': 'honeycomb'}
Prediction (mean, variance): {'compressive_strength': (np.float64(13.64923183743535), np.float64(4.403937782604568)), 'weight': (np.float64(6.516012283783041), np.float64(0.6335383388618753))}`
}
</CellOutput>

## Step 7: Compute Analyses

Ax can also produce a number of analyses to help interpret the results of the experiment
via `client.compute_analyses`. Users can manually select which analyses to run, or can
allow Ax to select which would be most relevant. In this case Ax selects the following:

- **Arm Effects Plots** show the metric value for each
  [arm](https://ax.dev/docs/next/glossary#arm) on the experiment. Ax produces one plot
  using values from its internal surrogate model (this can be helpful for seeing the
  true effect of an arm when evaluations are noisy) and another using the raw metric
  values as observed.
- **Scatter Plot** shows the effects of each trial on two metrics, and is useful for
  understanding the trade-off between the two outcomes
- **Summary** lists all trials generated along with their parameterizations,
  observations, and miscellaneous metadata
- **Sensitivity Analysis Plot** shows which parameters have the largest affect on the
  objective using
  [Sobol Indicies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance-based_sensitivity_analysis)
- **Slice Plot** shows how the model predicts a single parameter effects the objective
  along with a confidence interval
- **Contour Plot** shows how the model predicts a pair of parameters effects the
  objective as a 2D surface
- **Cross Validation** helps to visualize how well the surrogate model is able to
  predict out of sample points

```python
# display=True instructs Ax to sort then render the resulting analyses
cards = client.compute_analyses(display=True)
```

**Modeled Arm Effects on compressive_strength**

Modeled effects on compressive_strength. This plot visualizes predictions of the true
metric changes for each arm based on Ax's model. This is the expected delta you would
expect if you (re-)ran that arm. This plot helps in anticipating the outcomes and
performance of arms based on the model's predictions. Note, flat predictions across arms
indicate that the model predicts that there is no effect, meaning if you were to re-run
the experiment, the delta you would see would be small and fall within the confidence
interval indicated in the plot.



<PlotlyFigure data={require('./assets/plot_data/3917de73-f007-43da-92d0-2a7715d1eae7.json')} />


**Observed Arm Effects on compressive_strength**

Observed effects on compressive_strength. This plot visualizes the effects from
previously-run arms on a specific metric, providing insights into their performance.
This plot allows one to compare and contrast the effectiveness of different arms,
highlighting which configurations have yielded the most favorable outcomes.



<PlotlyFigure data={require('./assets/plot_data/fbe59611-88e2-4dbf-b05c-9065cc2e04b0.json')} />


**Modeled Arm Effects on weight**

Modeled effects on weight. This plot visualizes predictions of the true metric changes
for each arm based on Ax's model. This is the expected delta you would expect if you
(re-)ran that arm. This plot helps in anticipating the outcomes and performance of arms
based on the model's predictions. Note, flat predictions across arms indicate that the
model predicts that there is no effect, meaning if you were to re-run the experiment,
the delta you would see would be small and fall within the confidence interval indicated
in the plot.

**Observed Arm Effects on weight**

Observed effects on weight. This plot visualizes the effects from previously-run arms on
a specific metric, providing insights into their performance. This plot allows one to

**Modeled Effects: compressive_strength vs. weight**

This plot displays the effects of each arm on the two selected metrics. It is useful for
understanding the trade-off between the two metrics and for visualizing the Pareto
frontier.



<PlotlyFigure data={require('./assets/plot_data/fdc0a0da-9853-42a7-a5ee-46141c26d014.json')} />


**Utility Progression**

Shows the best compressive_strength value achieved so far across completed trials
(objective is to maximize). The x-axis shows trace index, which counts completed or
early-stopped trials sequentially (1, 2, 3, ...). This differs from trial index, which
may have gaps if some trials failed or were abandoned. For example, if trials 0, 2, and
5 completed while trials 1, 3, and 4 failed, the trace indices would be 1, 2, 3
corresponding to trial indices 0, 2, 5. The y-axis shows cumulative best utility. Only
improvements are plotted, so flat segments indicate trials that didn't surpass the
previous best. Infeasible trials (violating outcome constraints) don't contribute to the
improvements.



<PlotlyFigure data={require('./assets/plot_data/408e3845-697f-4052-9ad9-ce98d99788a6.json')} />


**Best Trial for Experiment**

Displays the trial with the best objective value based on raw observations. This
reflects actual measured performance during execution. This trial achieved the optimal
objective value and represents the recommended configuration for your optimization goal.
Only considering COMPLETED trials.

**Modeled Effect on the Objective vs % Chance of Satisfying the Constraints**

This plot shows <b>newly generated arms</b> with optimal trade-offs between <b>Ax
model-estimated effect on the objective (x-axis)</b> and <b>Ax-model estimated
probability of satisfying the constraints (y-axis)</b>. This plot is useful for
understanding: 1) how tight the constraints are (sometimes the constraints can be
configured too conservatively, making it difficult to find an arm that improves the
objective(s) while satisfying the constraints), 2) how much headroom there is with the
current optimization configuration (objective(s) and constraints). <b>If arms that are
likely feasible (y-axis), do not improve your objective enough, revisiting your
optimization config and relaxing the constraints may be helpful.</b> This analysis can
be computed adhoc in a notebook environment, and will change with modifications to the
optimization config, so you can understand the potential impact of optimization config
modifications prior to running another iteration. Get in touch with the Ax developers
for pointers on including these arms in a trial or running this via a notebook.

**Cross Validation for weight**

The cross-validation plot displays the model fit for each metric in the experiment. It
employs a leave-one-out approach, where the model is trained on all data except one
sample, which is used for validation. The plot shows the predicted outcome for the
validation set on the y-axis against its actual value on the x-axis. Points that align
closely with the dotted diagonal line indicate a strong model fit, signifying accurate
predictions. Additionally, the plot includes 95% confidence intervals that provide
insight into the noise in observations and the uncertainty in model predictions. A
horizontal, flat line of predictions indicates that the model has not picked up on
sufficient signal in the data, and instead is just predicting the mean.

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Ax's `Client` for optimizing the strength of 3D
printed parts in a human-in-the-loop setting. By iteratively collecting data and
refining parameters, you can effectively apply black box optimization to real-world
experiments.
