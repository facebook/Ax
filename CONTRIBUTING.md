# Contributing to Ax
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
  For the most seamless developer experience, we recommend that you install
  all optional dependencies for Ax.
2. Please see the [Code Requirements](#code-requirements) section for requirements on unit testing, code style, documentation, etc. These requirements are enforced via Travis for each PR.
3. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Code Requirements

The Ax codebase has a high standard for code quality, which we enforce via Travis.

### Coding Style
We use the [`Ruff` code formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) for all Python files. You can install the latest release via `pip install ruff` and run it over the library via `ruff format ax`.

### Unit Tests
The majority of our code is covered by unit tests and we are working to get to 100% code coverage. Please ensure that new code is covered by unit tests. To run all unit tests, we recommend installing pytest using `pip install pytest` and running `pytest -ra` from the root of the Ax repo. To get coverage, `pip install pytest-cov` and run `pytest -ra --cov=ax`.

#### Code Style

Ax uses [ufmt](https://github.com/omnilib/ufmt) to enforce consistent code
formatting (based on [black](https://github.com/ambv/black)) and import sorting
(based on [Âµsort](https://github.com/facebook/usort)) across the code base.
Install via `pip install ufmt`, and auto-format and auto-sort by running

```bash
ufmt format .
```

from the repository root.

#### Flake8 linting

Ax uses `flake8` for linting. To run the linter locally, install `flake8`
via `pip install flake8`, and then run

```bash
flake8 .
```

from the repository root.

#### Pre-commit hooks

Contributors can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run `ufmt` and
`flake8` as part of the commit process. To install the hooks, install `pre-commit`
via `pip install pre-commit` and run `pre-commit install` from the repository
root.

### Static Type Checking
We use [Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/) for static type checking and require code to be fully type annotated. At the moment, static type checking is not supported within Travis.

### Documentation
* We require docstrings on all public functions and classes (those not prepended with `_`).
* We use the [Google docstring style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) & use Sphinx to compile the complete API documentation.
* To rule out parsing errors, you can run Sphinx from the Ax root via `sphinx-build -WT sphinx/source sphinx/build`. The `-W` flag will cause Sphinx to break on the first error.
* If adding a new module to Ax, please add it to the appropriate Sphinx reStructuredText (rst) file (see [here](https://github.com/facebook/Ax/tree/main/sphinx/source)). We have a check in Travis for un-documented modules.

## Website

The Ax website was created with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), with some customization to support tutorials, and supplemented with Sphinx for API documentation. See the [website/README.md](website/README.md) for more details.
