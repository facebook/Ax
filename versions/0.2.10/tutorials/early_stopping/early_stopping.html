<h2 id="Trial-level-early-stopping-in-Ax">Trial-level early stopping in Ax<a class="anchor-link" href="#Trial-level-early-stopping-in-Ax">¶</a></h2><p>This tutorial illustrates how to add a trial-level early stopping strategy to an Ax HPO loop. The goal of trial-level early stopping is to monitor the results of expensive evaluations and terminate those that are unlikely to produce promising results, freeing up resources to explore more configurations.</p>
<p>Most of this tutorial is adapted from the <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ax_multiobjective_nas_tutorial.html">PyTorch Ax Multiobjective NAS Tutorial</a>. The training job is different from the original in that we do not optimize <code>batch_size</code> or <code>epochs</code>. This was done for illustrative purposes, as each validation curve now has the same number of points. The companion training file <code>mnist_train_nas.py</code> has also been altered to log to Tensorboard during training.</p>
<p>NOTE: Although the original NAS tutorial is for a multi-objective problem, this tutorial focuses on a single objective (validation accuracy) problem. Early stopping currently does not support "true" multi-objective stopping, although one can use <a href="https://github.com/facebook/Ax/blob/main/ax/early_stopping/strategies/logical.py">logical compositions of early stopping strategies</a> to target multiple objectives separately. Early stopping for the multi-objective case is currently work-in-progress.</p>

<h2 id="Setting-up-the-Runner">Setting up the Runner<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-up-the-Runner">¶</a></h2><p>Ax’s <a href="https://ax.dev/api/core.html#ax.core.runner.Runner">Runner</a>
abstraction allows writing interfaces to various backends.
Ax already comes with Runner for TorchX, and so we just need to
configure it. For the purpose of this tutorial we run jobs locally
in a fully asynchronous fashion. In order to launch them on a cluster, you can instead specify a
different TorchX scheduler and adjust the configuration appropriately.
For example, if you have a Kubernetes cluster, you just need to change the
scheduler from <code>local_cwd</code> to <code>kubernetes</code>).</p>
<p>The training job launched by this runner will log partial results to Tensorboard, which will then be monitored by the early stopping strategy. We will show how this is done using an Ax

<h2 id="Defining-an-Early-Stopping-Strategy">Defining an Early Stopping Strategy<a class="anchor-link" href="#Defining-an-Early-Stopping-Strategy">¶</a></h2><p>A <code>PercentileEarlyStoppingStrategy</code> is a simple method that stops a trial if its performance falls below a certain percentile of other trials at the same step (e.g., when <code>percentile_threshold</code> is 50, at a given point in time, if a trial ranks in the bottom 50% of trials, it is stopped).</p>
<ul>
<li>We make use of <code>normalize_progressions</code> which normalizes the progression column (e.g. timestamp, epochs, training data used) to be in [0, 1]. This is useful because one doesn't need to know the maximum progression values of the curve (which might be, e.g., the total number of data points in the training dataset).</li>
<li>The <code>min_progression</code> parameter specifies that trials should only be considered for stopping if the latest progression value is greater than this threshold.</li>
<li>The <code>min_curves</code> parameter specifies the minimum number of completed curves (i.e., fully completed training jobs) before early stopping will be considered. This should be larger than zero if <code>normalize_progression</code> is used. In general, we want a few completed curves to have a baseline for comparison.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <code>PercentileEarlyStoppingStrategy</code> does not make use of learning curve modeling or prediction. More sophisticated model-based methods will be available in future versions of Ax.</p>

is the abstract representation of how we would like to perform the
optimization. While this can be customized (if you’d like to do so, see
<a href="https://ax.dev/tutorials/generation_strategy.html">this tutorial</a>),
in most cases Ax can automatically determine an appropriate strategy
based on the search space, optimization config, and the total number
of trials we want to run.</p>
<p>Typically, Ax chooses to evaluate a number of random configurations
before starting a model-based Bayesian Optimization strategy.</p>
<p>We remark that in Ax, generation strategies and early stopping strategies are separate, a design decision motivated by ease-of-use. However, we should acknowledge that jointly considering generation and stopping using a single strategy would likely be the "proper" formulation.</p>

<h2 id="Configuring-the-Scheduler">Configuring the Scheduler<a class="anchor-link" href="#Configuring-the-Scheduler">¶</a></h2><p>The <code>Scheduler</code> acts as the loop control for the optimization.
It communicates with the backend to launch trials, check their status, retrieve (partial) results, and importantly for this tutorial, calls the early stopping strategy. If the early stopping strategy suggests a trial to be the stopped, the <code>Scheduler</code> communicates with the backend to terminate the trial.</p>
<p>The <code>Scheduler</code> requires the <code>Experiment</code> and the <code>GenerationStrategy</code>.
A set of options can be passed in via <code>SchedulerOptions</code>. Here, we
configure the number of total evaluations as well as <code>max_pending_trials</code>,
the maximum number of trials that should run concurrently. In our
local setting, this is the number of training jobs running as individual
processes, while in a remote execution setting, this would be the number
