    "## Trial-level early stopping in Ax\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial illustrates how to add a trial-level early stopping strategy to an Ax hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) loop. The goal of trial-level early stopping is to monitor the results of expensive evaluations and terminate those that are unlikely to produce promising results, freeing up resources to explore more configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of this tutorial is adapted from the [PyTorch Ax Multiobjective NAS Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ax_multiobjective_nas_tutorial.html). The training job is different from the original in that we do not optimize `batch_size` or `epochs`. This was done for illustrative purposes, as each validation curve now has the same number of points. The companion training file `mnist_train_nas.py` has also been altered to log to Tensorboard during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Although the original NAS tutorial is for a multi-objective problem, this tutorial focuses on a single objective (validation accuracy) problem. Early stopping currently does not support \\\"true\\\" multi-objective stopping, although one can use [logical compositions of early stopping strategies](https://github.com/facebook/Ax/blob/main/ax/early_stopping/strategies/logical.py) to target multiple objectives separately. Early stopping for the multi-objective case is currently a work in progress."

    "## Defining an Early Stopping Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "A `PercentileEarlyStoppingStrategy` is a simple method that stops a trial if its performance falls below a certain percentile of other trials at the same step (e.g., when `percentile_threshold` is 50, at a given point in time, if a trial ranks in the bottom 50% of trials, it is stopped). \n",
    "- We make use of `normalize_progressions` which normalizes the progression column (e.g. timestamp, epochs, training data used) to be in [0, 1]. This is useful because one doesn't need to know the maximum progression values of the curve (which might be, e.g., the total number of data points in the training dataset).\n",
    "- The `min_progression` parameter specifies that trials should only be considered for stopping if the latest progression value is greater than this threshold.\n",
    "- The `min_curves` parameter specifies the minimum number of completed curves (i.e., fully completed training jobs) before early stopping will be considered. This should be larger than zero if `normalize_progression` is used. In general, we want a few completed curves to have a baseline for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `PercentileEarlyStoppingStrategy` does not make use of learning curve modeling or prediction. More sophisticated model-based methods will be available in future versions of Ax."
