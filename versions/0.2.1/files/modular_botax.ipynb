A `Surrogate`, on another hand, is kept in memory as long as its parent `BoTorchModel` is.\n",

    "## 4. Using `Models.BOTORCH_MODULAR` and `Models.MOO_MODULAR`\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the instantiation of an Ax ModelBridge and its undelying Model, Ax provides a [`Models` registry enum](https://github.com/facebook/Ax/blob/master/ax/modelbridge/registry.py#L355). When calling entries of that enum (e.g. `Models.BOTORCH_MODULAR(experiment, data)`), the inputs are automatically distributed between a `Model` and a `ModelBridge` for a given setup. A call to a `Model` enum member yields a model bridge with an underlying model, ready for use to generate candidates.\n",
