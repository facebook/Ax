    "Typically, human intervention in Ax is necessary when there are clear tradeoffs between multiple metrics of interest. Condensing multiple outcomes of interest into a single scalar quantity can be really challenging. Instead, it can be useful to specify an objective and constraints, and tweak these based on the information from the experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate this, Ax provides the following key features:\n",

    "1. Constrained optimization\n",

    "3. Utilities for visualizing and deploying new trials composed of multiple optimizations. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how Ax enables users to explore these tradeoffs. With an understanding of the tradeoffs present in our data, we'll then make use of the constrained optimization utilities to generate candidates from multiple different optimization objectives, and create a conglomerate batch, with all of these candidates in together in one trial.
